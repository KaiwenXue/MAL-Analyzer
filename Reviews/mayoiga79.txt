In reality, this is not really a review, but more my initial reflections about the show. You see, I tend use the Tag section as an outlet for thoughts about the anime Ive finished, but in the case of Mayoiga, that is not enough space. There is simply too much I want to say about it. So, lets begin.

Essentially all of the characters adhere to a single trope of character type. In the beginning of the show, everyone introduced themselves to each other, every time a new character came on screen, I know who and what they would be. Now, Im

          
        not one to hate tropes. Theres a reason they exist, which is simply that they work. But when your entire cast can be neatly put into these boxes, you have an issue.

One thing that really stood out to me in a positive way, however, was how the show built the trauma of many of the characters.  Many of the reasons the characters where trying to flee from the world seemed realistic, and to a point relatable.

The story is fairly straight forward, to be honest, and theres not much to say. This show attempts to be a character driven show, so I can pretty much forgive it for that. I do want to rant a bit about the ending, and how anticlimactic and horrible it was.

And it well and truly was. The last few episodes had been pretty hectic, with big events and revelations happening all around. But then, instead of actually resolving the issues, it sticks in a romantic couple and calls it a day. It basically just forgives and forgets everyone, and acts like nothing happened throughout the span of the 12 episodes. Its like the author didnt know how to properly end it, and decided to just add a they lived happily ever after ending.   

In the end, I feel I must give this show a 4. Even though there were some positives, they were far outweighed by the negatives.
