It was interesting to watch and the story has a dark atmosphere but nothing that scars me for life. Honestly, I seen stuff way more scary than this and this is not scary up to the par.
The art I like a lot, it is smooth and clean as well as vibrant. The sound is good, your typical opening. The main point of this anime is to focus on the characters and

          
        their psychological well-being. I think it did a decent job. Enjoyment, I would say its pretty ok for a one time watch and I'm looking for more recommendations of the same mood. Overall, this is totally fine and it's being over exaggerated for being bad.
