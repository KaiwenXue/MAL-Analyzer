Intros are always cheesy, and almost all anime, especially those with large casts, present their characters as "types" in the beginning. This show is no different. I looked over this common convention and hoped that most of the characters would die off in a dead sprint of horribly awesome plot development and the others would be flushed out. This never happened. In fact, characters only seemed to be further pigeonholed into their respective stock

          
        inspirations as the show continued. After episode 4, each episode takes away from the show in a terrible way, leading to the lamest endings that ever lamed.

So the characters suck, but maybe there's a cool plot to this mystery here? Not really. All the intrigue is resolved pretty quickly and all the answers are given to you deadpan. Right when I was on the edge of my seat picking out details to figure out what was really going on, it was just explicitly told to me.

After that it's just the methodical resolution of a whole bunch of crudely connected character arcs that you haven't been made to care too terribly about, as if the director started with a whole bunch of cool ideas and then had to figure out someway to tie them all together. That being said, there are some cool subplots ironically. Figuring out who the bad guy is for example.

Ok. So characters suck. Plot sucks. Mystery sucks. Was it at least scary? No. Never. Creepy at times, I guess, but Corpse Party makes this look like a little girls tea party. Pass the crumpets and pass on this show. Trust me, it's not worth it. Maybe watch Death Parade? It's almost literally the exact same theme developed more clearly and with deep characters.
