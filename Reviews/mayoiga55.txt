But it took 4 episodes before anything actually happened then the rest of the show dissolved into the entire episode revolving around the whole group having an argument over whatever the current problem was and whipping themselves into a pointless panicked hysteria. After 8 episodes i got tired of 20 minutes of nothing but talking that

          
        lead to needless drama and 2 minutes of a hook to try to make u watch the next episode.
