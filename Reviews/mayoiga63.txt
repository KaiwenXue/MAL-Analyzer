Story- 2: Your typical mystery anime but with a peculiar concept. It has which has great potential, but it quickly falls flat. The story is enough to engage your curiosity but it is underdeveloped, the aftermath is unrealistic and the show overall fails at creating build-up. They are way too many cut scenes and by the last few episodes you'll find yourself getting seriously annoyed. 

Character- 1: The main problem with this show is that it introduces AT LEAST 30 characters which is insanely stupid considering that the shows is only 12 episodes. It's virtually impossible to become emotionally attached to any

          
        of them considering the amount of screen time each character gets. I can guarantee 70% of the characters will piss you off. Oh and it also took me ten minutes to confirm who the main character is. 

Art- Decent. Moving on.

Sound- 0.5: Huh? What sound? If you're like me and you love a good soundtrack at the more intense moments or if music is really what touches your emotions during an anime, then don't watch this show. Run while you still can. It's practically non-existent. 

Enjoyment- 2: Hey, I watched it to the end, didn't I? For twelve episodes, the plot went mind-numbingly slow. And if you thought anime logic couldn't get any worse then guess what- it totally can! As I'm writing this review I'm regretting continuing with this show. I'm questioning why I finished it... 

Overall- 2: In conclusion.... Try it for yourselves. If you dislike the first episode, then I can assure you will will dislike the entire series.
