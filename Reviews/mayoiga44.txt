When the anime begins, it holds your attention. Everything is so mysterious. A bunch of people inside a bus going to somewhere no one knows, no one ever heard. Everyone with the same wish: Forget about their traumatic past, but everything about this anime becames so bad after the first episode(or probably it was bad even in the first episode).

The main character is that generic cliche good guy(shy, positive no matter what happens), and he falls in love with a generic cliche good girl.

          
        The anime is full of generic characters. All of them. 
The story is poor, the CGI effects are all horrible. Horrible plot twists too. I don't have any opinion about the end, because I didn't watch it. This anime was too much for me.

The art style is kinda cool, actually, it's simple, not exagerated. Great character design. Nothing extraordinary, just cool.

If you're thinking about watching Mayoiga, just don't.
