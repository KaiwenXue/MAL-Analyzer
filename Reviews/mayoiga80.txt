At least that is what happened with this anime,after a strong first episode everything seemed to go down hill up till the final episodes where the whole trainwreck was explained in a completely trainwreck manner.
This will be a short review so don't expect from this either xD.
I came to this anime with high hopes of a plot-twist anime but in the end i received an anime which couldn't decide its pacing,had decent characters,had a completely pathetic story and spent too much time in trying to be something like Another.And don't even talk about the "ending" or

          
        what was supposed to be the ending,an ending is supposed to be a conclusion but what did we get? I'm not even sure so forget i said that^ xD
I recommend running away from this anime if you have not seen it,otherwise consult a psychiatrist to forget about this trainwreck,atleast that is what i want to do.
