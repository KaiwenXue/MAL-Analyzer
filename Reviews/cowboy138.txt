For me the biggest thing is, can I connect or feel some love for any of these characters and in all honesty, I couldnt. I didnt necessarily like or hate anyone character. I just felt indifferent. 

These characters are to put it simply, drifters. They dont necessarily belong anywhere else except all together.

          
        The show revolves around their bounties and along the way, pieces of the crewmates personal lives come to light. 
 I was in all honesty disappointed at how things ended with Spike especially concerning the women he loved and his former partner. It felt anti-climatic. Way too fast. You could tell we were getting their but there wasnt really any development. We got more development on Faye and Jets past, in the proper sense than we ever do with Spike. I honestly felt unsatisfied with his character development. 

The plot in general was very interesting. Its like combing the old West in Space with Jazz and Blues music which you honestly wouldnt think is a good combo but so is Gintama with space aliens and Meiji era samurai all in one mix. Some of the most surprising combinations go quite well together.
I will have to say one thing, the music was amazing. Personally speaking Im not really a big fan of this sort of music but I havent come across many anime that have such a unique musical style all their own. Its Cowboy Bebops signature.
