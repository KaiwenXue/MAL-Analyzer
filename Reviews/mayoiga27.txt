The story about being lost at a certain village with bunch of people who has psychological scars piqued my interest. Most people had dropped this because there are quite a few who had written some bad comments about this particular anime (DON'T JUST JUMP INTO THE BANDWAGON). But why won't you give this a shot. It's only worth 12 episodes, the art is not bad and the music is outstanding. This is not everyone's

          
        cup of tea but why don't you give this a watch and judge this for yourself. My only issue about this anime is that it contains a lot of characters and because of that, some characters were not executed properly and the ending could have been better. This should've been longer because the theme was really good and the characters were really interesting. This should've been longer to execute the plot more properly. This should've been longer for the characters to develop more. This anime should've been a bit longer. It's very promising, the art is great, the soundtrack is great, and the characters are interesting. All I see is an anime full of potential and it should've been a bit longer.
