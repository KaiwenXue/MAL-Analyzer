This anime got too many characters and hardly any of them are importants. Most of them are fucking annoying, make me want to punch my computer's screen hoping my fist would break through dimension knock them the fuck out. God, fucking Lovepon and her EXECUTION! 

This anime do a poor making me care about any of the characters. These characters are all losers who want to escape their lives because they fucking suck. We slowly learn how lame

          
        they are and then we got their weird fucking trauma manifest as creepy fucking shit. One of them got silicon as his trauma monster because he got one implant inside his head to make him taller, fucking lol. I kid you not.

Each episodes make you question the characters capability to use their brains because nothing they do make fucking sense. If you expect any good explaination for everything that's going in the series, you won't. I mean they explains it but its garbage. 

Overall, I regret watching this anime. I never give an anime such a low score but this anime deserve all of it. Fucking garbage.
