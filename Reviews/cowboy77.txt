I guess i'm the one being played now. 

This is elegant, stupidly elegant! It just REEKS masterpiece. OH MAN. And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack. It is just such a shame 'The Seatbelts' split up after only a few bebop related projects. Japanese jazz is mastered here, it only took 40 years after the genre peaked in some anime. Weird that. 
Eccentric Charles Mingus-esque bop and post bop is beautifully paired with extravagantly smooth folk and blues remnants. 'Jupiter jazz' and 'Space lion' will forever be this anime's masterpieces. 

Cowboy bebop, especially, can

          
        boast a tasteful blend of western and eastern styles of film, it never really takes itself too seriously. Do I need to speak about the writing? These characters are too charismatic for their own good, in life and death they exemplified perfection, Spike especially. Consistency would have awarded this piece a 10.

You're Gonna Carry That Weight. 
The weight that is at once the load of our past and also the promise and burden of unrealized hopes and aspirations for the future - the future Spike never had a chance with. As Shinichiro Watanabe once revealed about this line taken from the last Beatles's album, "The meaning behind that phrase, since the Beatles took a lot of weight from the fans, was that the fans had to now carry that weight."
This short series of 26 sessions has been nothing short of an immaculately conceived dream. The Bebop takes us on a joyride but sends us back with an encouraging lesson: while Spike is no longer able to carry the weight, we, whose lives and dreams continue, can. - [ Leigh ]

No piece can boast of such a mastery of sound and characterization in the history of anime. I definitely felt that weight.
