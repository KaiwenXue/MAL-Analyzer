Story: 9/10
I actually really like the story and the development of the Nanaki.

Art: 7/10
The art is good. It looks good compared to what I've seen before.

Characters: 8/10
The characters get introduced directly by a method that could happen in real life too (if you've never met the people before). The main character is irresponsible and that adds something to the anime for me. I quite like it. The only thing I dislike is the amount of characters in this anime, it shouldn't have this many and only have 12 episodes.

Enjoyment: 8/10
If you like characters to do the opposite of what you want them to

          
        do, you'll quite like this anime.

Overall: 8/10
Mayoiga doesn't deserve this many negative reviews. It's good in it's own way. If you like irresponsible and stubborn characters, you'll like this.
