This time however, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of bashing. Mayoiga, has proven to be the reason I'm almost bald from questioning the logic and horrible decision making. The concept seemed  extremly promising, and i was looking forward to being scared here and there. But that was as good as it got. The show itself is the biggest piece of trash i've ever had the ill faith to see, even sharknado had a better story.

          
        Mayoiga gave me the chills thinking that someone actually took the time to write and animate it. 100/10 do not recommend, wish i could rate this negative.
