It is an enormous task to make a well written original work anime with this many characters, and sadly the staff wasnt up to par, because they even failed when it comes to the few main characters. And the final product is one of biggest messes of this year, a total clusterfuck.

- The main story isnt half bad, it at least got me interested in watching this, but with each passing episode, you see that the writers are making this stuff on the go,

          
        there is no way this was structured beforehand. There are also a few stupid plot twists thrown in, most of them with no actual weight behind them, there is a little to no explanation behind things going on, beyond a few lines of exposition. (2/10)

- The animation is decent at best, with a lot of low points. Characters have mostly very bland facial expressions, a those who actually are expressing emotion(s) a lot, they still lack a lot of dynamics. There are also some bad uses of CGI used later in the series, painfully out of place looking, paired together with mostly bad design. But the biggest flaw is that the anime fails to build any kind of atmosphere with the visuals, it is completely incompetent to portray any kind of creepiness or mysteriousness and given that most of the anime should feel that way, I just cannot give it a pass. (3/10)

- On the other hand, I actually liked both the opening and ending. Sadly everything in between sucked. The voice actors failed on most characters (however I would guess that bad script and poor story didnt really help them) and the voice of Mitsumune is a bit obnoxious. And just as animation, the sound design was so bad that it also failed to build any kind of atmosphere, and by this point I think that this anime was made by a bunch of amateurs for their first bigger project. (2/5)

- Oh my god, where to begin. Bland characters with no development. Majority of them are one dimensional at best, some of them are even less than that, like they never change how they act or think, no matter the situation. A few of them get a short, sad backstory, but again, with no real weight behind it and its just there to check off character development of the to do list. There is no, not even a little, chemistry between the characters, no feeling of love or friendship or even trust, absolutely nothing. For all I care, they could all die at any point in the anime and I would feel nothing for them. (1/10)

- And despite all of the absolutely atrocious scores I just gave, I must admit, I actually enjoyed it a bit and I wanted to see more. Maybe not so because it was good, more because I wanted to see it they can make it even more stupid or if by a miracle, the show would actually get better. Spoiler alert, I guess, it didnt. However, that means it had enough entertainment value that it kept me going to the very end, a very low key end, but I do hope this is the end of this series as a whole. Edit: Apparently not, there is manga coming out right now and I actually hope it will be much better than the anime. (5/15)
