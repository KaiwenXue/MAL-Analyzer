For this review Ill disregard what its about as MAL provides a description, but express the issue with it. The story line establishes itself as a "death flag" style show. The scenes are set up to be eerie and uncomfortable, but ironically, they fail to do so. The show builds itself to be scary and uncomfortable, but instead became laughably bad. Each character felt stale, irrational overdone, the way the behave is odd

          
        if not hard to watch. 

The plot line starts ok, but spirals out of control till its basically doesn't follow any progression or story line. It jumps and skips around to eventually explain its goal, which doesn't fit the show well to begin with. Music and artwork is fine, but not memorable, and with the characters distasteful feels flat.

Overall, this show just was poorly executed. Characters were mehh, many scenes felt wildly inconsistent and out of place,  and the ending was stale due to  no connectivity with the cast or setting. In short, if your looking for a dark show, this is not the place to start. Shows like Another, or shiki do a far better job.
