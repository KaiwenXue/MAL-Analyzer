      
    this was the biggest load of crap i ever seen in my life, all that potential wasted and this really had promise at the start

but then we get to know the characters...
now just to note my favorites were hayato nanko maimai jack valkana i believe sorry i never remember his name but you know who i mean, those were my favorites

however...they started off great and then slowly butchered later!
hayato is the perfect example of a great character ruined by bs backstory and sudden switch from concerned overprotective friend to friggin obsessed yandere, yes his backstory was tragic having abusive and controling parents then being locked

          
        in an attic with a creepy picture of your dead grandmother staring at you is enough to screw anybody up, but that was not a valid excuse for his sudden change in personality, if you just established he had extremely manipulative and controlling parents then why the hell would he go and do the same to mitsumune? its bs and contradicts his whole backstory and personality change, basically hayato's character was RUINED

hayato's backstory should have been slightly different, instead of just using mitsumune as his puppet it should have been hayato had something dear to him that was taken in a tragic way, then after meeting mitsumune he realizes now he has something else dear to him he wants to protect, that would of easily explained his overprotectiveness and given their friendship a much more stable and sensible ground instead of just making him into a selfish prick that only used him, hayato is still my favorite because he was the only one besides when he went yandere asking the real questions and acting smartly through out the situation and was able to finally understand mitsumune's feelings and accept him as an equal

now we all remember the dreadful reveal of lovepon cat girl and military guy which also made no damn sense, lovepon being abused by her stepfather gave her absolutely NO reason to want and murder everybody she came in contact with, being abused by a piece of crap stepfather does not justify her having such a huge bloodlust, cat girl was understandable but still pretty lame, and we all know the worst one....silicon boob implant....seriously? if that was supposed to be terrifying they did a poor job on it, that was the stupidest thing i ever seen in my friggin life

now mitsumune ill give credit he had a pretty decent backstory and believable reason for going on the tour, however him as a character is straight GARBAGE i mean he met this girl masaki for 5 seconds and then hes just like to hell with hayato, yes when hayato got out of hand i agree he shouldnt of listened but not all the time hayato was wrong infact he was 100% in the right and clearly just concerned for him and what does mitsumune do? he ignores him and keeps getting involved with her anyway and is constantly getting into all types of horrible situations because of it, she even almost got him killed MULTIPLE times and he STILL kept chasing after her, no matter how many times hayato warned him he kept not listening, hell he didnt even care how hayato felt at all he completely forgot about him all because of this girl masaki now he just forgets his best friend since childhood for some random girl hes only known a DAY

honestly mitsumune is the true definition of a bad friend, despite hayato going yandere i have to put a huge blame on mitsumune for that because he never once considered how hayato felt, he never once thought about hayato in any of the dire situations it was always MASAKI who was first to come to mind and who was hayato's? MITSUMUNE, seriously if he can drop his friend that easily over a girl hes only just met then he really shouldnt have hayato let alone anybody as a friend, hayato did genuinely care about mitsumune and that was made clear by the ending when he accepted his nanaki and admitted that mitsumune gave him confidence and freedom which is how this should of went from the start instead of making him appear selfish and manipulative

30 ppl in a 12 episode anime...needless to say over half of them didnt get a single bit of development and the ones that did were absolutely dreadful minus mitsumunes and the rest were bland and just oh well that sucks

the ending was pointlessly dragged out and by the end more then half stayed behind for the most bullcrap reasons and less then half left with some common sense, your in a place where your deepest fears manifest as monsters that is still very unknown and still needs alot of research to be done about it and trust the lady who was manipulating you this whole time, yea makes total sense

on a side note jack was another wasted character, he was my favorite simply because he didnt take anyones crap and was willing to kill a bastard for trying to bully him, yes a bit of an over reaction but if you been bullied your entire life and finally snap you have nobody to blame but the ppl that pushed them to it, i understood jacks situation from being bullied and snapping in such a way myself however they went on to portray him as a serial killer and villain, basically portraying a victim of extreme bullying who retaliates will go on to be a serial killer and betray everybody, seriously wtf?

what should have happened was jack was simply fed up and defending himself, when he got out instead of becoming a psycho killer he just simply went into hiding and was even secretly protecting them this whole time or just hiding out scared, later on when hes found they eventually prove hes a good person and innocent and he re joins the group but nope they had to make him evil and stupidly make him actually work with the other jack who he previously was trying to kill because he messed with him, like wtf? seriously WASTE of a good character and horrible portrayal of what victims of bullying are really like, their not crazy serial killers, they are FED UP with being a punching bag and striking back which others see it as an act of an insane person its really an act of self defense, when ppl snap their not thinking rationally their acting out of fear and pent up anger from being bullied so long, but enough of that i just really their portrayal of that

overall enjoyment was really 1 but i rate it 2/10 simply cuz the art and animation wasnt terrible and a few likeable characters

i actually did like a few characters even though they ruined the potentially good ones if you ignored their bs portrayal you can still see where the characters were good at and if i had to choose a different main character it would be hayato hands down and cut the yandere bullcrap, story had promise but was executed as absolute garbage, characters had potential that was wasted and others just simply served no purpose at all, art was decent and had variety atleast, music isnt bad but easily forgettable, enjoyment started off high then ended in an all time low, want my advice? DONT WATCH IT unless just to laugh at how bad it is, seriously just skip it and go to corpse party or something
