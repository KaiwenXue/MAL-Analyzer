      
    I feel bad for this anime.

Mayoiga has such big potential to be a really good anime. Peoples who are tired of their lives and want to start over a new one by joining a tour and they ran to a new place far from the 'real world' to live together. This theme could be improved and create a really good story.

At first, Mayoiga is really good. How they survive, the challenges and things that happens. But, the story reveal the 'villain' too easily. I don't know if it just me, but I could tell who set everything up in few firsts episodes.

The ending is the

          
        most disappointing part. It has no impact at all. Like when you're in the middle of writing an essay or story, then got bored or tired or lost on track in what you're writing, then you just quickly sum everything up in few paragraphs which there should be a lot more going on. The story was finished in a blink of an eye with no explanation or part of how it happen.
