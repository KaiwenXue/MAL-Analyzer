Ok first of all. This anime obviously made a lot of people disappointed, but just because it was able to do that was I able to enjoy it even more than I already had. This anime was tagged as Mystery and for the entirety of it I was just left wondering at awe in every episode. Even though the flow of the story was bad and it could've gone way better, I was able to enjoy this anime because of how crazy it is and how people are getting frustrated over it.

Story(6)
Yeah the story is pretty bland and the flow is a

          
        bit horrible but it's certainly not mediocre because it is pretty damn unique.

Art(8)
The visuals were great and the monsters/Nanaki were just awesomely creepy.

Sound(8)
The audio was pretty great actually. I really like the ED song. Oh, and of course how could I forget Koharun's eerie song.

Character(7)
It's good. Not great, but good. Each had their own unique crazy personality.

Enjoyment(10)
It was like riding a roller-coaster 'nuff said.

Overall(8)
I don't understand why people are giving it a lot of hate. It's certainly cut from a different cloth, that much I can say. I won't be able to see an anime as crazy as this one for a long while and I'm glad because I myself might also become even crazier if I keep watching more anime like this. It's a pretty great anime and it's definitely not for sane people.
