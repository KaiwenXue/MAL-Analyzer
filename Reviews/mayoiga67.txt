I wait every season for brand new horror and with the same team that worked on Another working on Mayoiga I went into this with high expectations. Plot wise it sounded like something of a cross between Silent Hill and Higurashi. The large cast in addition to this leads you to believe that an impressive body count is inevitable.  Abandon any and all hope of this. Mayoiga is light fare.
 My experience with this show  was something like playing Apples to Apples junior after being used to

          
        Cards Against Humanity. As horror it fails abysmally unless you happen to be frightened by the cute penguins from Mawaru Penguin Drum. At this point one might expect it to deliver as a suspense/mystery show. Mayoiga also fails to achieve this. The plot ends up feeling confused, meandering, and aimless; uncertain as to what plot point, themes, and characters to focus on. World building might have saved it but there wasn't any. Any explanations offered at the end of the show concerning any "mysteries" feel half assed and are unsatisfactory.
The characters are all unoriginal and forgettable.Same goes for the setting of the show. I can't recall any part of the soundtrack either. The animation is average but any attempt at being new and unique it makes just ends up being laughable.
Give this show a pass. There are 0 redeemable qualities to it. I promise that you are not missing out on anything.
