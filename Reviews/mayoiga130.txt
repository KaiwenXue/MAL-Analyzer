No really, I'm not even joking. The anime is an equivalent of a shit expensive sports car. You're in for a ride, sure. But when you rev that engine you get nothing but "FFFFFROOO-eugh".

Gotta be honest with you. I actually enjoy the first... 3 episode. Like it was actually engaging. The start clearly stated that the whole show is going to be a bit fucked up. Second... gives you that feeling. Third... starts to wear down, sure. But you still have that edge. Then... nothing. Just a few "OH!?" and "Oh? What?".

Art style. Great. I

          
        like it. I love how the characters look. Love how the background looks. It's engaging and beautiful.

OP/ED is a bit of a meh for me.

Character development. Stale as FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. Not gonna lie, the only engaging character is the main character who's probably a retard. The main girl who's to be frank quite cute. Then the old man at the last one who puts everything together. That's it. DONE. Everyone else? LOL FUCK 'EM

Honestly, if they actually show at least a hint of everyone's background a bit, I'll be fine. NOPE, they just make them forgettable. It just ends up with a lot of moment where I would scream "FUCK YOU" and shove my middle finger up my screen.

Overall. It's shit, I'm disappoint with the ending. I'm disappoint with how everything went. It becomes a stale yet edgy.

This anime... I want to forget about it... Maybe I should join that "get-away" village that nobody knows...
