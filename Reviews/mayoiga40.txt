The show is very much intentionally bland and generic and it utilises this to produce very meta-structural humour. The end is in a way genius as it suddenly and anti-climatically ends as if to say "What? Did you expect more" 

That being said the show also suffers from having too many characters. Though a large amount of these characters are intentionally generic and bland being used entirely for comedic purposes some of them receive so little screen time and are so flat that

          
        you wonder why they're even there (though in a way that could be the sheer genius of it). Episodes 10 and 11 are largely exposition heavy and end up bringing up more questions than answers and in general being very stupid. The whole "Boss" thing with the Jack's, the becoming tired, lazy and unfiltered shit, it is all very stupid and poorly explained but at the same time hilarious. 

Overall this show is a big joke and I enjoyed it as such. Go into it expecting a horror/mystery/thriller,ect and you will be disappointed, go into it with an open mind and no expectations and you will have a good time.
