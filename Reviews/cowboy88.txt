The storyline is great.
If you want to know if you're going to like Cowboy Bebop, I suggest to watch the first 4 episodes, they are a small introducing to the rest to the series. 

The story is about a space cowboy named spike, he is a bounty hunter on the ship the bebop. Together with Faye and Jet he collects bounty's, this isn't going that well all the time, therefore Cowboy bebop has a lot of humor, unlike most anime. 

The episodes selves are all different stories in one storyline, that's what makes Cowboy bebop unique. Every episode has got a lot of action

          
        in it, so it'll never bore you! It's really different from the other anime, but it's still good. 

All characters in the Bebop has his own backstory, which all get's unraveled during the series. 

I really enjoyed watching this serie and I highly suggest you to watch it. 
It has everything, again! Action, a bit romance, depression, humor and even horror (it's my opionon of horror ;))
So if you want a good anime, I suggest this one.
