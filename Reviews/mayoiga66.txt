This anime isn't really a "horror" anime like the tags say, but more along the lines of a supernatural mystery.
The story is about people who have experienced trouble in their past and banded together online to take a trip to a rumored hidden village where they can "start over." This of course doesn't go as planned and they started seeing mysterious things. 
i can't really say much

          
        or I'll be spoiling the whole thing, but basically the kids have to reopen old wounds and face their past.
The art was pretty good and a certain grandma in the story was so well drawn it had me wondering how they could draw it so detailed.
Sound wasn't that bad
Characters development was okay. You don't really see much going on except with the protagonist Mitsumune and the characters he interacts with most like Masaki and Hayato.
I enjoyed Mayoiga even though I was originally looking for an actual horror anime (I've seen so many I just can't find any anymore).
It's a good watch but it's not something that will have you hyped up and talking about it for weeks to come.
