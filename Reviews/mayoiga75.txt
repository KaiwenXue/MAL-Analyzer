a) edgelord
b) likes Tokyo Ghoul
c) likes Another because hurr durr so mature

I hated Another but I ended up enjoying this show and you know why, it's because of how salty the "reviewers" and "le expert connoisseur" became. I expected this show to be a train wreck and sure enough it did but it's so unpredictable it ended up becoming enjoyable.

Besides that, this show actually has some valuable things to learn from but I won't spoil that for you. I'm sure you all are smart enough to figure it out.

The soundtracks are decent, nothing really stood out but I did enjoy

          
        the opening and ending. The character designs are pretty basic but I'm not an artist.

The characters, well most of them are either annoying or you just don't care probably because it reminds you of yourself. 

To conclude, I hope there won't be another show like Mayoiga because whatever comes after this show that tries to be it will probably fail. This show is like something that comes once every time the planets and stats align and I dare say I enjoyed it.

Again, don't watch it if you're one of these types of people I listed and you'll probably go from hate to enjoying the hell out of it.
