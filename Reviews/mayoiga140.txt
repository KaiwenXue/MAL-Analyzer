The questions of why each person was heading towards the village, plus how they grow over time and come to terms with those reasons and the mysteries of the village is a big driving part of this anime and something that I thoroughly enjoyed.

The biggest problem I found with the anime is the characters, yes I loved most of the main ones, and everyone had their own reasons for coming to the village.  The problem

          
        is that many of them didn't seem to develop much beyond that, and it wouldn't be a huge problem normally, you have anime with a lot of side characters and it's no big deal. Here though you have around thirty characters that are supposed to feel part of the story, but for big chunks of time are ignored, or are just there to show whats going on, it just felt a bit odd to me.  

Thankfully the ones they do focus on are interesting and I think make for the best parts of the anime, their story is what it focuses upon and gives you a reason to invest in the series.

The best part I would say is the entire mystery behind the village, what is happening there and so on, it's one your learning about right up till near the end of the series and keeps you guessing about things.  This definitely works for me as you learn at the same time as some of the main characters.

I felt that over all you get a satisfying and enjoyable anime, it's not perfect with a few problems, but I definitely enjoyed it over all and recommend it.

I give it a 7 out of 10
