This was the show that got me into anime, which looking back at how much time I've lost to it since might not have been such a good thing. There's just something about this, it's easy to feel but hard to pin down. The characters have incredible chemistry, the english dub is one of the best ever recorded, the art style is beautiful and stands up well for it's age, and the soundtrack is probably the strongest I've ever heard. You can tell that the creators had a lot of fun making this because there

          
        are so many unique pieces that all fit together in the end product. It's sort of timeless, and I don't think it'll ever stop feeling cool. I keep this show about 5 feet from the DVD player at all times, and this is the first show I recommend to anyone asking me about getting into anime. It's not nostalgia, it's just great. Without a doubt, it was the best of 1998, which had Trigun, Serial Experiments Lain, and Outlaw star all come out then too. If you haven't seen it, but you watch anime, what is wrong with you? This is one of the biggest pillars in anime history, you owe it to yourself to see it.
