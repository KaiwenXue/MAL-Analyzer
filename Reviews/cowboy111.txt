         
    I rated this anime by how I watched several anime in the past 2 years. In celebration I am writing this review to start my reviews.
WARNING: Some spoilers ahead.

First of all this Cowboy Bebop is like several anime in the past like Pokemon and Voltes V which makes the debut of the new character or new plot elements to introduce in every episode.
Cowoby Bebop does the same but makes something different out of it. You can call it Sessions.

In this sessions the viewers will watch how several aspects of life, or futuristic aspects implemented in the show. 

In terms of story I enjoyed several nostalgia

          
        effects of the books that you may have read or heard about the wild west. Both the art, sound, character resonates with the story as no single narrator is to explain what is happening or what is going to happen to our characters.

This makes Cowboy Bebop a classic with just PURE animation which nobody will not expect what will happen and makes you join the ride in which delves into the deeper themes of the show such as loneliness, future corruption of the environment, and space travelling.

You JUST WATCH and SEE what happens in this show. That's the perfect way to enjoy it. You may need to go back and see it again if you need.
