A one time in a lifespan journey. A diamond in the anime world. A chest full of gold buried in a very deep hole that everyone forgot about. This is Cowboy Bebop.

By the year of 2014, many people would rather watch One Piece or SAO or whatever they watch thats new, instead of watching Cowboy Bebop since its outdated to say the least. It doesn't have a sharp animation and the drawing is no way near what it is today. Well, if you think like this, then fuck you. You don't deserve

          
        to experience what this masterpiece has to offer. The other ones who can get past its look, be sure that the reward is higher than that.

Cowboy Bebop doesn't follow a typical story, which only adds to its uniqueness. Its episodic and that means every episode = a new story to be told in this MASSIVE universe. Its strange how no one wants to do another series in this universe, not following the past characters. But i can understand that, because no one will repeat the succes of what Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno did. Nonetheless, every episode is interesting and i wasn't bored a single time.

The Art is amazing, but i can see that someone will not like it. Well, good then.  The future is still very believable and i'd rather have this future than Star Wars and such.

The Sound is as good as it gets. Seriously. No other anime has what CB has packed in 4 discs i believe. The Jazz... enough words.

The Characters deserve a special spot in my soul. I will always remember the charming Spike, experienced Jet, lost Faye and crazy Ed.

This is without a question, the best anime out there. Go watch it right now. You can thank me later.
