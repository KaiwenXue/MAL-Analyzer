I decided to watch Cowboy Bebop because it was done by Shinichiro Watanabe, who also did Samurai Champloo, which is one of my all time favorites. If you watched Champloo, Bebop is similar in that both follow an episodic format, where there is some kind of a story or plot, but the story itself is not as important as the journey. In Champloo, this was the search for the sunflower samurai. I guess in Bebop the main plot focus could be considered Spikes

          
        backstory and the whole situation with Julia.

Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters Spike and Jet and there adventures as bounty hunters and the other bounty hunters, Faye and Edward who they meet along their journey.

I think the most interesting part of Cowboy Bebop is I guess the main protagonist, Spike Spiegel. Although I do not necessarily the episodic format to be a bad thing, I feel that it sometimes took away what was the most interesting part of the show, which for me was Spike's backstory. Spike is a very interesting character - he is very mysterious, not to mention that he is very skilled at his job.

Enjoyment 8/10

Overall 8/10

Had some moments which where interesting/entertaining, however I have trouble recommending Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece as some people do. Still a show worth watching if you enjoy the genre.
