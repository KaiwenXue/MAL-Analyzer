I kept waiting for the death count to happen. Theres more characters then you can count, and its just weird. But oddly enough i kept watching the series for some reason. You want to find out what the hell is happeneing and who's screwing with everyone. Basically the cast have to fight against their fears and their fears manifest into some weird crap. Seriously the monsters here are screwed. Some monsters you just spent 5 minutes trying

          
        to figure out what they are. Like did Picasso do the designs for them?? And a lot of characters didnt get tragic back stories so you wonder ''what the hell are they doing there?". This was dissapointing, no gorey deaths and no fan service. The only good trait is some scenes are oddly funny, and the idea that everyone has some type of suffering, and the proper thing to do is accept them and move on and not run from it. But theres no reason to see this if you haven't already.
