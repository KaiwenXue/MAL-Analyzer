The overall anime is good and it had promise to be even better. In my point of view it had way too many pointless filler episodes and didn't really find good balance between being serious and laughable. I felt like the seriousness of the whole story was bit diminished by the fact that there were so many episodes just for laugh and giggles. 
I think that this anime would have been way better with a little bit more serious tone. It let me a bit

          
        confused. Not bad anime by any means. Its just,,,I expected it to be bit better.
