Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of risky things. They must create new

That quote is probably a valid review of the first 24 episodes of the anime.

Cowboy Bebop is a set of parables, picking up and dropping off at whatever random points the main characters happen to stumble upon them, and in some cases, ending them. The beauty in Cowboy Bebop stands in the one story that we kinda sorta actually get to see. The story of Spike. I would argue that just about every other story told would be just as interesting as his if only we had the time to more fully develop the characters and plot. But Spike's story, that one we do get the pleasure of experiencing. The weight that we get to carry. 

This anime is about a very specific aspect of the human experience: empathy. It forces us to empathize with a roster of characters and watch them struggle. Not at all to the extent that as something like Texhnolyze, but enough to make you really ponder the reality of what you've just seen. Every character lives and dies by their own decisions, and you're tasked with burdening those decisions; to understand and accept them. 

Other than that, it's simply an astonishingly good looking, good sounding, mostly episodic, perfect anime with tons of style points.
