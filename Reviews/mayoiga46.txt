The ratings/reviews seemed  daunting, but I took a gamble, and I'm glad I did. Right from the beginning, I was impressed with animation and sound work. The music was very complimenting to the scenes. As it progressed, I liked the physiological aspects quite a bit. The story was fresh, and kept me interested until the end. The feeling of never knowing what might happen next was quite inviting. You also get an emotional

          
        understanding of some of the characters. I was really able to empathize, and  shed a few tears in the process ! 

       Now, a good review has to include the negative aspects. To avoid spoilers for the first one, I'll just say "The Secret of Nanaki village." Some of these "Secrets" were animated in a cheesy manner, and didn't accomplish what their intended purpose was. The story also had some issues. More could have been done to explain setting, but more importantly, the ending seemed rushed. It didn't include much resolution, and definitely was not as satisfying as it could have been.  

       All and all, Myoiga isn't for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it. If you want a mystery style anime with a little romance, action, and emotional character stories, it is a good short watch. 

Overall, I give it a 7.5/10. Not quite an 8, but that .5 is well deserved.
