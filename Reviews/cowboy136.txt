The story was very good at keeping you interested it did lack a backbone and you never tricked yourself into believing that the characters were in much trouble, up until the end that is and boy do I love that ending. the art is absolutely gorgeous I believe it was one of the last animes to be drawn by hand and it shows. the music I

          
        quite enjoy but if you don't like blues you might not enjoy it as much. the characters are somewhat average though I'm told it was quite new for its time and even though it is somewhat normal now they play their characters well. Overall I wholeheartedly enjoyed it and I would recommend watching it and in the dub as its one of the best dubs out there in my opinion.
