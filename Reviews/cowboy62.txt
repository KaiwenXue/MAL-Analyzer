FOREWORD:
For those of you who have grown up watching good anime your whole life, let me tell you a little secret: there was a time not all that long ago when translated, licensed episodes didn't exist in the U.S. This wasn't just because most people didn't know about it; in reality, the majority of Americans simply weren't interested. Cowboy Bebop changed all that. 

SUMMARY:
Of all the shows I've ever seen, this one takes the cake. Just because it's old doesn't mean you shouldn't watch

          
        it- in fact, it's pretty difficult nowadays to find anything of a similar caliber amidst the never ending wave of eye-candy garbage that big name companies have begun to produce. 

Cowboy Bebop will lead you on an incredible adventure- one that is certainly full of tasteful humor and suspense, but also possesses an unexpected level of depth and meaning. It will draw you in gently with its art and sound, captivate you with its character development, and move your soul with its plot. 

The lighting, angles, and details in the art are unmatched. The music, too, is tasteful and unique, and compliments the atmosphere of each scene exquisitely. Every character is developed meaningfully throughout the show, and their distinct personalities are coordinated in a way that is both refreshing and endearing. 

This show will take your breath away. It will open up new vistas of thought, and leave you with a heart that better understands- if only a little- what it truly means to be human.
