- This show failed as a Horror because there was nothing remotely scary about this show. The only scary part about this show is how badly paranoid these characters are and how they seriously need to go to a therapist. There's also a bunch of monsters in this show but they're not scary because some them of looked ridiculous like a giant penguin monster and a giant breast-cup monster. Yes, "Breast-cup"...I kid you not. Haha, you think they're going to use ghosts to

          
        try and scare you? Nope.  

- This show failed as a Drama because there was nothing good about the show's drama. It took itself too seriously and instead of grabbing my heart to show how much I feel bad for the characters, I grabbed my face to show I much I face palmed throughout this series. I can barely focus on one "sad" flashback because there's a lot of them jam-packed into 2-3 episodes or probably more and you expect me to feel bad for 5, 6, 7, 8 characters just because their "tragic" flashbacks were shown? That's not enough. 

- This show failed as a Mystery. The show might seem mysterious at first but you'll realize that it's not because of its stupid plot. It's also filled with stupid ass writing and at the end, you're going to be asking more questions than getting your questions answered. Like, why in the mother of god did some of the character suddenly become lazy and sleepy while the other half were completely active? 

- This show failed developing it's characters properly. Who in their right fucking mind thought that it was ok to have 30 characters in a 12 episode series? At the early 2nd half, they decided to fill 2-3 or so episodes with flashbacks of almost every major characters. The episodes felt like a steaming pile of mess while I was watching it because there were too many flashbacks. I did say almost every major characters right?....Some of the characters were just ignored and never to be seen again in the 2nd half. Hell, I don't even know 65% of the character's names. 

- Speaking of not developing its characters properly, the show also failed on the characters as a whole. Most of the characters were annoying and just plain stupid. Like cmon, you guys are in this weird village and you guys claimed that you're going to live in said village for the rest of your life yet you can't even fucking get along with each fucking other?!

- This show failed as a Psychological because there was nothing psychological about this show. Most of the characters were just paranoid and screaming at each other because they have goddamn trust issues. Especially that "Execute" girl and Shouting Glasses-kun who have some serious trust issues against Masaki and they just wave off whatever she tries to fucking say even though all the things she said were true. 

- This show failed at Organization because everything in the show was all over the place and it was a mess. The story wasn't told properly and there was a lot of unanswered questions, especially the ending. The characters..Well, you already know what I'm going to say since I already said it 2 times. You can barely focus on one character in this series and a lot of characters were just forgotten in the late 2nd half of the series.  

- This show failed as an Entertainment because there was nothing amusing about this show. Not the plot, not the characters, Nothing! Once the Summer Season comes, this show will be forgotten by almost everyone. 


I'm ashamed that this show turned out to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. This anime had the potential to become one of the best horror/mystery show because the premise was pretty cool. A bunch of people visited a Lost Village and something bad happened to them one by one. How awesome would that have been? They could have gone the "Corpse Party" route except less gorey and this show would have turned out good. Except what we got is a pile of horseshit anime filled with non-nonsensical writing, stupid plot, unlikable characters, too much characters in a 12 episode series and an ending that makes no fucking sense.
