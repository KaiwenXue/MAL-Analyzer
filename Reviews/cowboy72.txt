Not because it wasn't a high quality, groundbreaking show that helped to define the genre, but BECAUSE it helped to defined the genre. I'll say now: I didn't grow up with this show. By the time I got around to watching it, I was about 20 and have seen these formulas and characters over and over again. Did Cowboy Bebop do it first? Probably not. Did they do it well? The popularity suggests they did it very very well.

However, over the years people have used this formula so many times that it has

          
        fallen into a cliche. To someone watching it (without nostalgia value) everything is predictable and gets painfully boring painfully fast. There wasn't anything shocking in it, nothing I couldn't see happening 5 episodes beforehand, and every character was one I had seen a million times before and wasn't interested in seeing again.

If you're asking me for specifics on what I didn't like, I can't even give that many. It was, for me, a totally forgettable experience.  While I would never deny someone their nostalgia, I'd warn newer viewers to check out something a little more fresh.
