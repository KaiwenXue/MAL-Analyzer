If you are looking for an actual good anime with decent animation and good story and writing and plot twists then please stay away, this anime is not worth your time to waste and here's why:

Mayoiga is an anime about a group of 30 people traveling on a single bus for a trip to a mysterious hidden village to escape their "Harsh" Lives and reality, to escape from their abusive or boring daily life until they are

          
        haunted by spooky monsters from their past

Story 2/10: What is this? Was this story written by grade schoolers?

Art 3/10: It's kinda decent but at some points the characters look disfigured or they use lazy animations and the CGI is almost as bad as the CGI that was used in Golgo, the monsters in the anime look truly pathetic, there's almost no effort put in drawing and designing the monsters

Sound 4/10: Nothing special

Character 1/10: The characters are the worst thing about this anime, everyone is really cringe worthy and annoying, it's like every Hollywood horror movies, everyone screams around or freaks out for no damn reason or does something stupid, everyone acts edgy or childish except for 2 or 3 characters that their personality and actions are decent, everyone acts crazy or does stupid stuff for no convincing reason or clear explanation it's the "The character writing was crap so shut up and deal with it"

Enjoyment 2/10: Yeah i guess you can enjoy this a little if you skip 75% of the parts

Overall 1/10: A waste of time.
