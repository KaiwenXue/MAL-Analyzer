            
    Even back in my high school years, when I used to catch a random episode of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim, and I would be thoroughly entertained.

Now, as an adult, I have come to appreciate this anime even more. Cowboy Bebop is not an anime that follows today's "Let's make everyone pretty, and kill a dramatic scene by throwing an iron pan at someone's head". Cowboy Bebop, to me, is the essence of what a great anime is.

Even though the show's main storyline is only truly there through a small handful of episodes, each episode leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained. Each character gets their moment

          
        in the sun, so to speak, with some intriguing info on their backstory (usually in the form of an episode) that left me completely glued to the screen.

Awesome soundtrack (I still have it on my playlist to this day) , paired with great characters and well written episode to episode stories, leave the viewer wishing more anime out there did the same thing.

I found it shocking that this anime was not listed in the top 3. Cowboy Bebop still has great rewatch value for me (maybe every couples years or so, but it's there) . Drama, Comedy, Action, all perfected.  I feel this anime definitely deserves to be listed in the greatest anime of all time.
