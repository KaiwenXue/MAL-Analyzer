         
    many people complained about this serie but i rather enjoyed it,
yes it has it flaws, yes it underwelming and yes it finishes with a lot a plotholes, but boy was it unpredictable, every time i was left on edge thanks to cliffhangers and every time it is resolved in a way i did not expect

i think the best way to enjoy this anime is take it as is, not as mystery but rather a roller coaster ride, not try to solve the mystery just let take you to the solution

of course certain things were predictable even more if you think too much about it, but

          
        you get left with too many plotholes.
