This show gives you 30 characters and tries to make you care about all of them, if that's even what it can be called. I can't even remember

          
        half their names. usually I have a favorite character in every show I watch but after having watched 11/12 episodes I can safely say that nobody in mayoiga will make it to that spot. They're all completely unlikeable and two-dimensional. strong characters can carry a weak plot but strong these characters were not.

I can't say anything else about this show is more than mediocre. It's not even 'so-bad-it's-good'; unless you enjoy, in some manner, watching groups of people whose names you can hardly remember arguing with each other for half-hour stretches, this show is honestly a huge waste of time. I only kept watching because I don't like to leave series unfinished - but I really don't feel like coming back for the finale.
