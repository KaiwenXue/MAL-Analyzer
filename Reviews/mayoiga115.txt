      
    Okay so this is my first review and all i can say is...why did i put myself through these 12 weeks? I'm telling you guys now do not waste your time on this series it is really bad...and its upsetting because i like mysteries and psychological series and it caught my eye while i was looking through the spring 2016 list but this was not what i was expecting from mayoiga every episode after the 3rd i believe was very dreadful to watch but i was curious to see how it ended and boy did i not expect that to be the ending of mayoiga,

          
        it was pathetic really i didn't get any enjoyment the characters were horrible they weren't well developed at all,they were annoying and just dreadful to listen to the art and animation is nothing too bad but it is still far away from good... i give this series a 1 it is probably the worst i have ever seen...
