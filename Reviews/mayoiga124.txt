       
    TL;DR because I don't feel like this anime deserves an in-depth review. 

Synopsis: People with "problems" decided to take a bus to go to a village where they can disappear. Shit happens, a shit ton of people get introduced, and then they get to the village. Black guy always dies first so then they have to find out who was the killer. 

Story: 2 (Major ass)

The story is complete ass.

Art: 3 (Lighty seasoned Dick)

The art is mediocre but... with a dash of dick.

Sound: 5 (Eeeh? shrug)

Whatever

Characters: 10 (Amazingly Fleshed Out)

The characters in Mayoiga really give you a peek inside the mind of a group inbred

          
        paleolithic sped kids.

Enjoyment: 3 (Right hook to the taint)

I'm bleeding.

Overall: 1 (Grotesque Ass)

Cancer.
