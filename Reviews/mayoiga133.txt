On MAL as well this anime is pretty hated which is pretty weird cause if an anime has a low rating on MAL I almost never like it but for this anime, I found that I didnt hate it. In fact, I was looking for things to hate while watching the show because I thought I was missing something. 

A huge trope of the survival anime is the Lord of The Flies, building factions type of thing and in this one, near the end, the factions

          
        were very interesting. Not to do with persecution or anything to do with sadism/wanting to kill others but in  two factions of people that were willing to deal with their fears to get out of the place they were stuck in and people that succumbed to sloth and fear. In the beginning it was more like a normal survival anime but they switched it up, which is pretty brave. Most survival animes have very few people that actually survive because a lot of the point is to introduce unlikeable characters and get rid of them, which is one strategy to focus on a select few characters. In here there is less of that waste of characters. If you dont like a character or set of characters, most likely they arent going to disappear anytime soon. 

The main reason I found this anime to be good, however, is the backstory of the Lost Village. A lot of events made more sense, including the reason why people even come to the Lost Village and why its called that. It created depth to the story and looking at the situation logically, there might be a solution to getting out of the Village that depends on the characters themselves, which really led to exploring and testing characters in non-trivial way. By the end, I ended up not really hating anyone, and in fact feeling bad for some which I think is the mark of a good show.
