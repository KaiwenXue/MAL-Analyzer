All of the characters (except Jet and Faye) are dull and lifeless especially the stereotypical bounty hunter and gangster spike spiegel. He is a wasted character who tries to be compared to Bruce Lee and Lupin the third and Steve Blum's voice acting makes him sound like a creepy pedophile. 

Enough the animation and music pull's me in it still make's itself a overrated example of corny neo noir

          
        and western shows that go really bad over time. Even though I like to respect your opinions, this critic is going full swing on how truly awful this anime is. 

So in my final verdict I give it a 0 out of 5 for being less than mediocre and more tightened up with a hell load cat shit. For all those professional critics and strong fans who it's perfect we'll it's not and nothing is not my own and and not your opinions too. They call it the greatest anime well I call it when you just get of the toilet after having a horrible stomach ache.
