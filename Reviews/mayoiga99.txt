I really did try to give this anime a chance, hoping that it only starts out slow and becomes a masterpiece at the end, but I was definitely disappointed by episode 7. The first two episodes definitely had my attention, Mayoiga displays certain hints of mystery, but it's not enough to keep the audience watching. The story itself mid-point was poorly written, there wasn't much mystery or suspense incorporated into the story line, and those that were included were meaningless to

          
        the plot, or just plain out predictable. The artwork was alright in certain episodes, but it just wasn't eye-candy or anything compared to other mystery animes. To sum up this anime, it's not worth watching if you're expecting a masterpiece of a jaw dropping mystery anime.
