Everything feels constructed and all people are boring. The characters act absurd to fit the plot and instead of developing empathy with the characters to feel for them we just start hating them. I don't care about them. The solution at the end seems false and plastic. After ~6 episodes I thought 'Awww man! Just die already altogether!' I wish I had aborted the show.  It's a

          
        waste of time. Just don't watch it, please!
