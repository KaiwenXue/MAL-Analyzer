The first couple of episodes...though it presented a pretty huge cast i was interested. It had a kind of MTV Real World vibes with a supernatural spin to it. I think this was a good idea.... a mysterious village where your worst fears are manifested....but it was not well executed... it was not well written..at times it just felt chaotic and at the closing episodes it was rushed and had a not so exciting end. I felt disappointed.. I was tugged along desiring for questions

          
        to be answered...but the answer felt insignificant and unimportant. The story was so bad...it felt like the writers were writing and making additions every week lol. 

The artwork was good for the most part....except when they used CG....like why....why do that... it was horrible.

The only part of the show i really looked forward to was the opening theme song and animation. That was the best part.
