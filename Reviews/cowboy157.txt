         
    Cowboy Bebop directed by Shinchiro Watanabe is one of, if not the best anime that has ever been made. You can call it unoriginal, predictable and you can say that the story is too rigid. The thing is, no other anime has done something like this with so much style and finesse. 

When I decided to write this review the best thing I could compare it to for me, was the video game The Last of Us, one of the most critically acclaimed and best games of all time. The story, the writing, the characters all kinda cliche, but what it does is perfect it

          
        like no other work in the medium has. But saying this, the last of us has been out for a year and who knows when it will be beaten. Bebop has lasted for over fifteen years as the most beautiful and artistically, for the lack of better words, 'nailed it'. I emplore anyone who loves anime to watch this before they die, because no one has or will recreated the magic of Bebop.
