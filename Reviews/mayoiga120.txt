Starting this anime without knowing the genre surprised me, as I thought this would be a light-hearted plot, but it got deeper and deeper as the characters' stories unfolded. Indeed there needed to be a huge character-flaw for this to work, because after all they are trying to escape from the world that's different from them. (People who haven't been through the sense of rejection from society, or had been hurt emotionally or physically wouldn't want to seek refuge in an unknown place, at least not for me.)

          
        And that kept me sticking close my screen, opening one episode after another, hoping to understand what actually was going on and why they were experiencing different things. The more I watched, the more I thought that the plot was pretty clever. I hope people don't depend fully on the ratings but give this anime a chance. I'm glad I did.
