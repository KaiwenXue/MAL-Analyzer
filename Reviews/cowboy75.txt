First of all, the characters, artwork, music, sound effects were absolutely incredible and way ahead of it's time. SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!!! But the story just didn't do it for me. The main villain I felt was not developed enough to make me care about him and it's because of this, the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist just didn't resonate. I will say the final episode was very well done and entertaining but in the end, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied

          
        by the whole show. I can't say in my right mind that I'd recommend it to everyone. For people who love episodic shows, this is as close to heaven as you can get. But for some that don't love that sort of format, I'd recommend to at least give it a shot as there is some high quality material to be found here. In the end, it was still an enjoyable experience and that's why I give it a 7.
