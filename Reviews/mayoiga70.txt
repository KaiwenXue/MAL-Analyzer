The story, such that it is, is about a creepy village where people with problems integrating into society escape so they don't have to deal with their problems. What follows is a clusterfuck of characters we barely care about (if we care at all) yelling and screaming at each other as mass hysteria sets in. There is barely a plot other than this yelling at each other and the character's various neurosis manifesting themselves. With such a large cast of characters you would think at least one would apply any sort of

          
        logic but they don't. It falls to plot devices to tell the viewer anything important that happens in the story. The characters themselves are uninteresting and ridiculously tropey in the worst way.

Terrible anime. Terrible story. Absolutely mediocre design and animation set to non-existent sound design and vapid character writing.

I wont disparage anyone else's reviews but I wholeheartedly believe that the 7s and 6s I see are due to pity or not understanding that 5 means mediocre, not 7.
