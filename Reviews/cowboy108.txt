The thing about Bebop is that it is in fact a classic. I can see that. In the same way I am not a big fan of classical music but can recognize the brilliance of Motzart, I can see that Bebop has its merits. 

The story and the characters work very well together. It feels like an anime version of Firefly (which personally I'd also right at about a 7). 

The thing is that, it wasn't really thrilling to me. The lack of a real long term

          
        plot didn't really invest me in the characters. The characters felt deep and well-developed, and each episode individually wasn't bad, but the thing about episodic anime to me is that they can't really reach a climax. Even though Bebop's end climax was solid, it is different than watching characters change and struggle on a journey to reach the approaching peak. Bebop was sort of everyday living in this new world, then story resolution at the end kind of. 

I enjoyed it. It was solid storytelling, good characters. But I just can't get behind the universal praise Bebop receives. It's good, but no masterpiece.
