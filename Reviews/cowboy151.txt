The story of Cowboy Bebop is the misadventures of a group of space cowboys/bounty hunters with a rift of humor, drama, adventure, action and sci-fi that blend together well with old-time jazz backtracks. From the genius of Shinichiro Watanabe was where this space adventure sprang from and it is an old gem I will always love! And the end is a cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what happened

Art-10/10
Watanabe puts some great thought into the appearance of his charachters. They are intricatey designed to fit their persona. Spike Spiegel, our cool-as-ice, sharply dressed hero had a great design with tones of blue and yellow. Perfect compliment!

Sound-9/10
The voice

          
        actors in the dub (which I usually watch to get a clear picture in my head for my fanfics) are perfect, for the most part. Steve Blum, one of my all time fave voice actors, plays Spike Spiegel, and Wendee Lee plays the sexy and daring Faye Valentine. Their voices are well-suited. The jazzy backing music made for a mysterious and mellow environment, as well as spazzy chase scenes. The ending theme, the real folk blues

Charachters-10/10
The charachters are intricate and have very good backstories, be they major or one timers. Spike's romance with a beautiful blonde and rivalry with an old comerade are riveting to watch.
