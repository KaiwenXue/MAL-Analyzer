Story is a 7/10 from me. People go in a village, stuff happens, silent hill vibes. 7/10

Art 9/10, fluid art animation is quite seller. Much appreciated. 

Everything else *8/10) Characters were unique, concept was good. Got a Law exam tomorrow. 

Overall 7.5/10 or 8/10.

Kept me interested, one of the most important pieces of modern day anime.

Ok im going to go study now, bye.

Hold on, if this anime was really that bad, then...why is it getting good reviews.

People die if they are killed.
