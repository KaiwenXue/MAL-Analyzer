In the beginning this show just threw 20 different characters at you and had no idea what it wanted to do. The story was so confusing at first, but made sense at the end of the show. Most of the 20 some characters were mainly just background and had no use other then to just be there. I  think only half of them were actually used in the plot. The rest were just a bunch of characters that were just there to make the show look

          
        full. As for character development its kinda of hard to tell if there was any. But for at least one or two of the characters there was minimal development. Anyway if you want a quick mystery with some confusing plot that eventually makes sense this is for you.
