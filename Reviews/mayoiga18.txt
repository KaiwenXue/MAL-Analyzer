None of them made any sense. They acted unreasonable. The only good characters were like two of them. The rest of them acted like complete retards who kept wanting to "control" the situation by themselves! Especially Lovepon! Oh god she was the worst! She kept going on and on about the execution crap!

And what was with the ending!? After all that crap about beating each other, they suddenly started to

          
        act civilized!? Also the drama was awful! Most of the time, it felt forced. Honestly, I feel like the writers were pulling this story out of their asses each episode!

I mean. The concept was really cool, but the execution (no pun intended) was awful, especially with such horrible characters. I would NEVER recommend this anime.
