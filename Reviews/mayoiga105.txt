      
    So, at first, I kinda wanted to watch the anime, so I waited until it was finished, because, for myself, I hate having to wait each week for a episode. 
The poster was kinda nice, so yeah, I thought it would be a good anime.

But sadly, I didn't like it. It was really boring, and somehow, it got on my nerves so hard.
The characters were like, every stereotype of the typical average anime. They weren't well built, and when you think you can have some good development (I expected much about Mistumune and his bestfriend), you get disapointed because relationships, and character development aren't deep

          
        thought. They're stuck at their characteristic. 
I watched the whole anime, but I felt like losing my time when I got to the 9th episode. I'm curious, so yeah, I'll watch, but it gets so boring. You don't have to think, they give you all the hints, because they think you're an idiot. 
Anyway, even if you're bored, watching this anime is only going to make you waste time AND isn't gonna entertain you at all.

Also, the way they run, it's really funny. The animation completly forgets about perspective and yeah, at least, you can laugh for this, because there aren't funny moments in this anime.
