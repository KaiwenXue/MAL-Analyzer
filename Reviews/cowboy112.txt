Cowboy Bebop has been praised by fans and critics as the greatest anime of all-time, it set a benchmark in the 90s for animation quality, has some of the best storytelling ever written and is one of the most influential anime ever. 

The show is episodic by nature but has enough backstory in each character to give an over arching view. Focusing in on the Bebop crew and their not so successful bounty hunting adventures Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed make up four of the greatest anime characters ever. They each bring something amazing to the show. Ed the super hacker adds a light hearted

          
        element to the show that never seems to slow down or hurt the show in any way like so many other comic relief characters do, Jet the ex cop turned bounty hunter is kind of the father figure in the group, Faye the lovable gambling addict from the past who acts as a counter part to Spike and Spike... oh Spike, probably the coolest anime character ever, how do you not love this guy? he fights like Bruce Lee, has an amazing shot, has a dope backstory, is a total badass and has said some of the most icon quotes in anime history.

The animation is some of the best I've ever seen, backgrounds are detailed, the characters designs are all very unique, the fights flow like water and oh ya this is all hand drawn animation! no cheep tricks or cutting corners every frame of this show is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack on it's own is nice but coupled with the show is like the best anime soundtrack ever.it reminds me of Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver in how the music seems to fuse so well with the visuals to give the viewer a one of a kind experience. 

Overall Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows ever (anime or not), it has aged like scotch and is a must see for any and every anime fan. Until next time, see you space cowboy
