      
    The problem of a good concept is that if is doing bad all the concept fall, personally the concept of mayoiga is great, (spoilers) a place where everybody who wants to scape of the reality want to go because its a place hard to find out of the civilization, but is the worst place of the people that want to scape because they have to deal face to face (literally) with the things that they dont want to admit, why? because is a monster that do that shit and is anime so fuck the reazons.

The plot is good, why could be wrong? to me a

          
        lot of characters, like, at least 18, and is not like the other characters are the best ones of the industry, is that a lot of characters surplus, i mean ok, is logic that if you want to do your own village you have to have a lot of people, but the writer wanted that we care about every one, i lost a lot of time trying to remember all the names because probably they would have something to do, and i wasnt wrong at all, the fatty one was actually a little important, the rapper that i thought was only put to be the rapist that die first was important, but the fucking Lion, the best character if we talk about design, that was introduced with powers of see shits about death and was  like the god of something like a religion, dont do nothing.
or the fucking psicopath.

One of the biggest problems of the characters are the overacted that they act, specially the living stereotype of the Pseudo-clever character that looks like the boss and analyze shit and have glasses and loose the control when all go down, that is mentally unstable because one day he just dont organized  something in the toy train convention, and that makes him a psicopath that want to burn people like a witch hunter. 

Well, this is getting a little too long, and as you can see, i dont speak english very good, the truth is that this anime have a lot of points where we can attack, but the special reazon of why i wanted to do this review is because i thing that (like in this anime) a lot of people is exaggerating, i mean.

1/10? ok is not ergo proxy we know it, but is not that bad, first of all the general concept, second the opening is not that bad, not all the past where shit, i mean someones have very good concepts, and is logical that all the people that dont want to life in the society have psychological problems, for example i enjoy the reazon of the protagonist to go to the town and get a new life, to get a new identity that is his own identity, i like the way of how the anime turn to be a scary sobrenatural story to a antiscapist one, i liked that a lot of moments wasnt predictable, i liked how they do to make a stuffed penguin scary, i know that is not a great anime, but i doesnt mean that deserv a 1 or a 2 like something that didnt wanted to do a interesting story.
