      
    Mayoiga has a very low score and I can understand why people would give it such a grade, however, I actually thoroughly enjoyed Mayoiga.

PROS +

Mayoiga sold its self as a horror/thriller but it quickly changed into a story about running away from yourself. The large cast helped to add believable environments, especially one of the first sequences when introducing themselves on the bus ride to the Lost Village; it`s a bit nerve-racking but it`s alive like group settings with strangers in an ice-breaker.

Music

The ED Theme "Condensation (Ketsuro )" by Rina Katahira is a quiet sad tune that plays over some boring stills in the ED

          
        Visuals, it was nice to relax to, however not special enough to purchase.

CONS - 

Writing

There are way too many characters and many of them are used to add more specialty to the main cast when everyone turns for or against them. A bit of a spoiler but it`s funny how a few characters want to rip the others' guts out, towards the end, then suddenly become friendly in a second. 

Nobody here is exactly special either, except for a few such as the Detective and the background of our lead character (forgot their names already, haha).

Music

Honestly, BGM mixes in the back so well (good and bad) that I can hardly appreciate it in a film, anime, and etc.

The opening theme is a predictable J-Rock tune that made me think, "Oh it`s probably gonna get bloody like Shiki, (Mayoiga is nothing like that)" when hearing Shiki`s Faylan OP 2.

Directing

There is some disgusting 3D CGI.

-----

Mayoiga is a bit sad, it`s relatable to life, though, it didn`t do the best job at it.

7.5/10

Essential Watching?: No, but it provides a relatable experience.
