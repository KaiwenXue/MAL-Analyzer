But it was predictable, after all, is Mari Okada, closer than a SNL comediant than a drama writer, but at the beginning it was little promising. How stupid I was!

But, I recomend this anime,  if you don't see this anime for a complex story and character relationships, and simply you want to see a show because you don't have nothing to do. Give, at least, a

          
        chance.
