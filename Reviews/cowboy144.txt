Story: Bounty Hunters in space, while this isn't something that has been touched in fiction before I feel it does it the best. At times it's vague, which it doesn't need to be detailed with certain characters past not being completely explained till later adds to the mystery of some of them and the over all events that lead them meeting each came together pretty well. Had the right amount of comic relief and tension not many shows I feel do it this well no over zealous comedy

          
        and it was serious when it needed to be.

Art: For it's time the art is top notch, the environments are well designed, characters aren't all copy-pasted templates they are unique looking. Gives a nice mixture of the wild west, and space mashed together.

Sound: I loved the OST so much I ended up getting it for myself. I'm a fan of jazz, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The opening song is pretty spicey and smooth got to say it's one of my favorite Opening OSTs to date. Tank, Rush, Space Lion, etc never get's old listening to them.

Characters: The main characters work well together, from the chaos to the sad moments it feels like one of the better choices for bunching them together. Even a lot of side characters weren't dull and many times I was wishing I would see some again. 

Probably the best space bounty anime there is, and it left me wanting a little bit more feeling it ended to quickly.
