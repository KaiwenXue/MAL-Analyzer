*MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD*

Overall the anime doesn't jump out as awesome and I'm sure an anime veteran will be able to identify more things that are wrong. However, while I'm new to anime, I'm still very picky. 

The story is what really elevates this anime. The plot starts of simple, with folks leaving their real

          
        life behind to start over in this off the grid village. What this anime does is, take everything you think is going to happen and turn the other away. I remember mid season I was like, oh I get it. They do this because of that blah blah, but then the anime takes a complete opposite turn. I'm just like whooaaa.. That's what I like about anime, they have a way to M. Night Shyamalan everything. It's what kept me glued whole season. I kept getting it wrong and I wanted to know what happens next. The twists are great and somehow has a way to keep you guessing. 

The OST in the anime is not bad, the main theme that is played often sets the mood of the anime. The voice acting is fine and the art is nice, normal. I dislike over exaggerated art, this is more human like. The character development is a little lacking given it's 12 episodes and it's got like 15 characters or something. There is a plus side which is the lack of filler episodes. I hate fillers and this anime takes a few minutes here and there to explore that which also works as character development. 

I highly recommend it if you're into mystery anime. I don't really see anything wrong with this anime because even with the things I've mentioned that are lacking, it doesn't get in the way or reduce the anime in any way. It flows well and ends perfectly.
