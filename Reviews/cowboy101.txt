The episodic structure gradually reveals more and more about the characters while bouncing between tones and still being able to be taken as seriously or silly as it wants. With a plot that isn't exceptionally complicated, the pacing and delivery manages to make it exceptionally compelling. 

The visual style screams "cool" with fights given loving attention and characters moving around and interacting with interesting worlds. 

The music...
Sublime standing by itself, the Seatbelts

          
        blend of jazzy cool, contemporary mixes, and some American cowboy couldn't be imitated and hasn't been done since. 

 The characters are excellently portrayed and acted, with personalities that are crystal clear and enjoyable to watch. I honestly can't think of much else to say that won't come across as gushing; they're superb!

This series blew so many standard prejudices I had against anime out of the water. Here is an anime, where less is more. Less talking, less byzantine plots, less tacked-on elements, just tons of atmosphere and personality. Truly the bearer of the cup of which to baptize neophyte western Otaku, Cowboy Bebop is a series I cherish to revisit alone and with friends, and plan to do so for many years to come. 

Now I just have to wait for one of those $300+ blue-ray collections to fall into my lap and get Steve Blum to sign it...
