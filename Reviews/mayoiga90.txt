      
    This is my first ever review in MyAnimelist, but i just couldn't let this anime go without writing one.

Story
The Story was interesting all though kind of cliche. The basic problem I had with the story is that it never really leaved up to the hype of the first few episodes, some episodes who although were kind of vague they also were the ideal prologue to the series. A prologue who made you

Character 6/10
The characterization is the thing that made the show really anooying at some moment.
First of all by the time that Mayoiga ended i caught my self knowing just 6 out of nearly 20 characters names, that mainly happened because in just 12 episodes there were presented so many people who in fact  were not that different to each other to begin with.
Secondly all the characters seem to be completely dumb to an extent in which most of the time you want to punch them.

Enjoyment 7/10
The Enjoiment overall was good although for an anime pf the mystery genre it turned out being more of a slice of life thing.And mainly the enjoyment came from some great and special backstories that were presented, we should give them at least some credit. 

Overal 6/10
Promising anime that did not leave up to its expectations.
Nothing more nothing less...
