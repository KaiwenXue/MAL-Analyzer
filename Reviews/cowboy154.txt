WELL down right one of my favorite anime's because of its outstanding work on adventure comedy and plots through each episode that always kept me entertained. When i first heard about the anime and its accusations of being one of the best anime's ever by some reviews I was curious about it, what brought me closer is that it was made around the time I myself was born.As I  saw this the plots of each different episode were always there keeping me watching it from begging to end with its awesome music (intro and outro)  written

          
        by Yoko Kanno and performed by the Seatbelts that always had me hyped and so into it. I loved most every aspect of it and would recommend this amazing anime to any searching for a fun comedy, a badass sci fi, or some mystery type deal with a dramatic past. This anime deserves a 10 out of 10 (especially since it was made in 1998)
