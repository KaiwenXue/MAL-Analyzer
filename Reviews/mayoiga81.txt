I was watching, to quote reddit, "reddit on a bus."  That is, a bunch of random characters with barely hidden flaws go off on a journey.  

Story: 7
Very... different idea.  The story progresses at a decent rate with twists and turns to reach a relatively satisfying conclusion.  Don't go in expecting a Higurashi or a Shiki.  

Art: 5
Mediocre.  The art is fairly basic, that's really all there is to

          
        say.  Colors are good, atmosphere is decent.  The CG is jarring.  That being said it's still fairly watchable.  

Sound: 7
I didn't mind the soundtrack.  VA's did their jobs.  Nothing too amazing, but it fit the series.  

Character: 8
I'm heavily biased since I thought many of the characters were hilarious.  Are they shallow?  Very.  Are many of them boring?  Perhaps.  But they're a bit more nuanced than they appear.  For a 12 episode to eventually familiarize everyone with all the characters, one-dimensional that some may be, is in itself a feat.  

Enjoyment: 7
I enjoyed the show, laughing with it, laughing at it, etc etc.  You won't have a masterpiece here.  Expect that going in, and it might be worth your while.  

Overall: 7
Mayoiga attempts a lot in its short time.  Don't watch this as your hype anime of the week.  Watch it between.  It may be a semi-amusing part of your day.  Don't go in expecting a horror. Instead join for the character and the light mystery if they amuse you.
