Story was a killing point of this anime, which for the first few episodes felt completely different from the rest portraying itself in more of a mystery type genre which does not continue up to the point I have watched through. 
Otherwise the story feels well slow.

The art and story are what you would expect nothing to far out of the ordinary in either,

          
        besides some hiccups in the cg at points, most of which were likely played for uncanny and instead end up laughable. Music while actually quite well done was repetitive and had very few different leitmotifs and themes.

The characters are flat out abysmal. Mayoiga has many of the same troubles as many of other anime that have loads and loads of characters; being that they are all under-developed, relatively flat, go through minimal, if any, change in their character and some feel like decoration and inconsequential besides being named and given backstory. One pitfall unique to mayoiga is the fact that the main cast feel cardboard and cliched while some background characters are left in the dark besides feeling unique or interesting in comparison to the main cast.

I had a very hard time enjoying this anime at all, the beginning was just interesting enough to keep me going, but for the reason above I had trouble and was fed up of watching characters I hated going through a boring world.

In eight deadly words: I don't care what happens to these people. 4/10
