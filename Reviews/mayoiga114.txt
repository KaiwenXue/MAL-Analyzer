Story (7/10):
The story went with a good start.. Introducing the characters (lot of characters) who wanted to reset their life. They agree to participate on a "reset trip" to Nanaki village.

Later on when they arrived on the village they found that the village is somewhat weird plus every characters is mysterious. Imagine if you suddenly lives with the people that have hazy background in the same house (this was the hook of the anime). You'll find that each episode is revealing interesting card.
The downside though because there are a lot

          
        of characters in one cour series. So yeah.. as you expected the story is quite rushed wasting its potential.

Art(8/10):
Nothing to say. The art is good comparable to other 2016's anime.

Sound(7/10):
The OP is good. The bgm is good and support the mystery theme.

Character(5/10):
One sentence: how do you fill 10 liter of water in a bucket that has 1 liter capability.
Yeah it's nonsense. The analogy describe this anime. Maybe except the MC has good character development.

Enjoyment(8/10):
I actually find that this anime is quite interesting. The cliffhanger each episode drives me wanting to watch the next one. If you have watched bokumachi then you know the feel.

Overall(7/10):
I give it 7 instead of 6 because the last episode include some feels.
