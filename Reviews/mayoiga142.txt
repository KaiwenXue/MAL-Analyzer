Always left me screaming and so confused. Honestly could have been written better. and the plot twist were both insane and horrifying bad. Honestly i both recommend it and don't Like there were some reallyyy goood moments especially with the driver and each character who had a backstory, the backstories were well done..but it needed more episode to be complete. definitely has nothing to do with another.. of you wanna watch cause

          
        the guy is the same that made another welll you're gonna be super disappointed. But it was a fun and worthwhile show
