      
    I decide to review this anime, because it's unique. The beginning is quite promising and interesting, maybe because I'm a fan of mystery myself. However, I must face some disappointments when progress with the story. The biggest one is due to my expectation to see complex mystery or intense thriller. And what I get is pretty lame supernatural phenomena. Well, the Psychological aspect is good though, I even learn something from this show. 

Story: pretty good, but slow paced with a lot of unnecessary events to slap your curiousness

Art: The setting of village and surrounding are good, give you the right atmosphere, but I dislike

          
        those things designs (what are the things? see it for yourself by watching)

Sound: no problem with VA, soundtracks are good, and the best thing is the music. I really love the OP and ED 

Characters: a lot of annoying, weird, stupid or illogical characters, but those kind of people are whose supposed to join that shady trip, right?

Overall: Enjoyable with intriguing story and mystery, I recommend to watch it once you have full episode and enough time to watch it all at one go, to save you from cliff hanger and wild guessing
