So its about a bunch of people who want to abandon their live and live in some utopian village that no one can get to. Well following a classic stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to get home and mysterious monsters plot everyone is always fighting and suspecting other people of being evil. I'm sort of over that whole thing but it was tolerable because I  really wanted to know what was the monster and were they really

          
        all going to get out of the village. It was really good and kept me on the edge until the last episode. Seriously. The last episode SUCKED. you have been warned.  

The only thing that was wrong was the ending!!! I get it is hard to end stuff, but seriously!!!! But the rest of it was good. Very light romance which I liked because there was no reason for that to be the main focus. Another thing is that they go into a few of the character's traumas which is very important for the plot but they don't show EVERYONE's. I wanted to know about everyone but they only showed a few. The only way to leave is to accept the emotional scar and they didn't show everyone's emotional scar that they got over. 

Other than that really good.
