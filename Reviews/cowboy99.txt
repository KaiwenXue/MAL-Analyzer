Its got a great story that keeps the viewer entertained, laughing, and at some parts on the verge of tears that said I would like to say that I love the jazzy kinda dark feel of the overall anime and think that it was done very well. On the other hand I feel like it was pretty short... which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing because they didn\'t milk it for every dime like some newer anime but It leaves the viewer yearning for more.
