But to me I just don't give a damn about it, since it ain't that bad at all , in fact it was something that one should looked at in its face value. 

So......................

Artwise, I'm giving it a 4 over 10 since there isn't much of any fanservices that has occurred....not that I'm looking for it, but it was very decent to say the least.

Sound, not much

          
        for me to comment about it, as to who did the voices of the characters and the themes of the anime, so I think a 6 over 10 would be fair enough, since the VA who did the voices of the character were in their right age groups. 


Characters, ok so there are too many of them and the focus were all over the place, but in my opinion, what if writer Mari Okada wants us to look at the group of characters, not as per individuals, but as a single whole entity? Cu'z if we're to focus on the characters individually, then we the audience would be pulled in such dark psych of being disgusted with the anime itself, don't forget the anime has a psychological genre and it doesn't play within the characters it also pulls us into as well, so, I have no problems of rating this line a 8 over 10.   

Enjoyment, well just like everybody else, we expect someone to die, but that didn't occurred, nevertheless, its a 7 over 10.

The overall, was that this anime is something that one should look deep into and not someone who has a shallow mind, so if your looking for an entertaining anime were blood would be spilled, then this isn't for you......BTW, its a 8 over 10 for this anime. I'm OUT!
