This show is an absolute trainwreck. Anyone who says that this is supposed to be a comedy is just trying to justify Mayoiga's horribleness for some sick reason. This show is not supposed to be funny, and it isn't. Despite its lighthearted moments, it is not enjoyable. 

The story starts off very intriguing. The different characters who we see on the bus in the very beginning of the show seem like they could be unique. The story seems strange, but I think anyone would want to know where it is going.

This intrigue very quickly dies off as we see that the story

          
        makes no absolutely no sense even though it tries really hard to do so. So many of the characters have horrible backstories or backstories that seem extremely half-assed. I waited the entire season to see what Lion's backstory was, and let's just say I was very let down. Why I kept watching is another question honestly. This is the kind of show that you keep hoping will get better but somehow manages to get worse with each episode.

It seems like the writers for this show just threw in random events and called it a show. So many things that happen in this show seem forced and obnoxious. 

PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not think to yourself, "it can't be that bad," because I promise you it is that bad and worse.

Just to clear something up, I really did have high hopes for this show and it was on the top of my list for its season. It was a real let down for me, and I wish I did not have to say all of these bad things about it. The characters might visibly look nice and the animation is decent, but the story and character development are just a sad mess.
