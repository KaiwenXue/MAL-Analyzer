This review contains spoilers btw

Story: 
Interesting in a bad way   5/10

Art: 
Only thing with no outstanding issues in my opinion about the show. The CG was interesting   7/10

Sound: 
Opening was ok. I didn't care much about the sound. At most parts of the show, the characters and certain sound effects were really noisy... idk if u know what I mean but it's like the voice actors spoke very close to the mic   7/10

Characters:
Lol   5/10

Enjoyment:
Only reason I completed this was to see what happens at the end. Not much enjoyment in particular. Not gonna lie doe, I

          
        liked the beginning of this show, but was soon let down   4/10

Overall: (SPOILERS)
It felt like this show was tryna be a Jurassic Park without the dinosaurs. This show mostly involved the psychological issues of the characters, in terms of emotions and thoughts, and the troublesome beings that they have created as a result of those issues. The character with the most psychological issues, emotional and thoughtful confusion, and probably my favorite character while watching this show, was myself. Honestly, dafuq did I watch?

What did surprise me though was seeing a mixture of Toshio from the grudge and a Mawaru Penguindrum penguin. The show also surprised me with some Yugioh and Angel Beats vibes in the end.

I might have not enjoyed this for the reason that I was expecting either a Texas Chainsaw Massacre or a full-on ghost mystery or even something like Scooby-Doo with a definite culprit but less childish.

If u read this review, I will reccommend watching it but don't expect much. Maybe u will enjoy it better than I did.

Ima be generous and give this a 5/10
