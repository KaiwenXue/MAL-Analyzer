What makes an anime unforgettable? Characters, to be short and thick. Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animations of all time because, in its 26 episodes of 20 minutes each, it manages to reach the soul of the spectator in edges that the spectator himself was unaware of being possible to be reached, even more by a work designed. Shinichiro's anime has style - a lot of jazz! -, humor and drama pervaded by quality and especially of a tone of its own, standing out on any list of best anime and making it unique.
In this sense, the design owes much

          
        to its beautiful technical aspects. The animation of the action scenes, especially in Spike's fight scenes and in space duels, is breathtaking, especially given the year of the 1998 anime release. It goes so far as to outdo many (!) Current animations. Example of this soon sees in the first episode, where we know the style of the hairy and lazy Spike - an unforgettable image, although banal. Combining such quality with creativity in architecting an incredible range of scenarios, ranging from the most megalomaniac to the intimate.
My overhaul is 10 in any aspects, in anytime.
