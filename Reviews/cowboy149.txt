Story: A very original, and heart-pounding story.  One that tells a story of love, hate, and overall pure excitement!

Art: Perhaps not the best of it's time, but certainly among them.  Cowboy Bebop delivers very beautiful artwork, especially with all the images of the future.

Sound: Both the Japanese and English tracks were

          
        filled with great voice acting.  Also the sounds hit dead on perfection.  The interesting part about Cowboy Bebop is it's close relation to the jazz genre.  Much enjoyment of the sound from the brilliant artist Yoko Kanno.

Character: This was a huge plus for Cowboy Bebop.  The characters showed a very unique aura in their own way.  Matching very well with the atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop.  Spike being the main protagonist, also showing very mixed emotions showing much humor.

Enjoyment: I very well enjoyed Cowboy Bebop.  Perhaps it was the queer attitude of some characters, or the total hilarious moments.  It's one anime I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy.

Overall:  Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime which will hold a place in my heart forever.  Not only did I love it, but it played a big part in my life as well.  It's a great show for people of all ages.  Mixing classic jazz, futuristic bounty hunters, and great fight scenes.  Cowboy Bebop is one anime i would recommend to anyone.
