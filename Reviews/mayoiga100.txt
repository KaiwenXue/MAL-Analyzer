I do think that there were too many characters as some of them did gets pushed to the side and were just there, I think it would  have been better if there were a few more episodes so they could develop some of the other characters

          
        more but overall I really enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed when no one died as I thought that it was going to be a horror in some way but by the ending I had forgotten about that tbh. Overall a decent anime and one I would watch again :) 8/10 from me :) Also love the intro song sooo much!! Also like how they brought the hippopotamus song back at the end, thought that was a nice touch, kind of like it was ending right back at were it began almost like its not over and that its all going to happen again....
