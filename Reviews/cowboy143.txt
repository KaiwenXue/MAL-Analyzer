Story:10/10
 The story is unique and very creative. Most of it is told by flashbacks and you learn more about the past of the show as it goes along. It does it perfectly.
Art:10/10
 The art is amazing. Most old anime have an art style I don't really care for,(trigun for example.) but this is just awsome. The spaceships look unique, the character designs are wonderful, the way the drew everything is just awsome.
Sound:10/10
Nothing needs to be said here. Even if you haven't

          
        seen this you have heard of the phenomenal soundtrack.
Character:10/10
The characters could not have been more perfect. Thayer are all likable, and the development on them is very impressive. As the show goes along, you learn more about their back stories that will make you appreciate them much more.
Enjoyment:10/10
