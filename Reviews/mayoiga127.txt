STORY (5/10): Since the characters sees the village as their key to their paradise, the scenery of the anime is alright. The settings fits in with the concept that reminds me of a horror movie. There tends to be a lot of intensity, jump scares and cliff hangers (so you will constantly be up on your feet).

CHARACTERS (5/10): There is a lot of characters who have different personalities and circumstances that they had went through prior to disappearing. (Which in this case, they do explore it during the episodes). For example: There's one who has dealt with an abusive past

          
        which causes her to have a mental illness. Plus, There are some who are shy and have a hidden agenda. 

OVERALL ENJOYMENT (6/10): I'm not a big fan of this anime. Sometimes it's hard to tell which character is which. But their personalities and backstories help me remember some of them. Sometimes, I get upset at the characters because I hate it when some of them had to quickly judge others without proof. Whenever they to reach to end of each episode I just want to continue watching it just to see what will they do next during their time in the village.
