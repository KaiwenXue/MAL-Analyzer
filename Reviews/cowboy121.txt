          
    My favorite anime of all time.Classic.

Story-Ups and downs of ragtag bounty hunter crew made of ex-cop,ex-crime syndicate member,femme fatal,reverse underage trap and  genetically modified corgy .BeBop crew travels trough space in search of good bounty and usually bounty money is spent on paying for buildings,cars and other things they destroy during there hunt.

Art-I really don*t care that much about art,I mean I watched all episodes of One Piece 

Sound-Best soundtrack ever.The Seatbelts(band) is awesome they blew my mind.Mixture of smooth jazz,  bebop, and classical Mississippi Delta blues.Orgasmic

Characters-Hard to write with out spoiling but I can say that there development is very good.Also all

          
        crew members have some type of quirk  especially that reverse trap character

Enjoyment-When I started to watch I was bit skeptic about this anime but oh boy did I enjoyed the ride.I recommend this anime to every anime fan.

Overall-Combination of badass characters,epic story and orgasmic jazz/blues soundtrack makes this anime,in my humble opinion, one of best anime that is ever made.I will fight you if you say that this anime,this opus magnum of 
Japanese animation is bad.

SCORE:12/12 space lolis
