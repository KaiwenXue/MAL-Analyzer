      
    In the synopsis, the first sentence states that there will be a bus, and in this bus, there will be eccentric individuals. Not only are they eccentric, but they are absolutely exaggerated and beyond cringeworthy. In a nutshell, almost everything in Mayoiga is exaggerated and pretty dang weird. The hype around this anime was put to waste, and failed to meet the bar it set for itself.

Story: 1/10
Okay, I have some respect that the producers adhered to the synopsis, which was rather intriguing, but the story was pretty bland and boring to watch. The writing didn't help anything either. Sure they tried to be symbolic

          
        and deep, but that just didn't work out.

Art/Sound 4/10
The "Nanakis" didn't even look like they belonged in scenes. It was like watching many animating styles and artwork incorporated into one thing. The sound was nothing special, and none of the soundtracks really stuck out to me. The OP and ending were pretty decent as well.

Characters 1/10
Over exaggerated, unrealistic, and cringe describe the characters. Almost everyone is off their rocker, and towards the end, the cringe factor increases. Every character acted as if they had no common sense and that they took some form of hallucinogens before they went on the bus.

Enjoyment 4/10
I mean, I didn't drop the anime after the second episode.

Overall 4/10
If you just want to watch this for fun, don't. You'll regret wasting the time. If you hate exaggerated, stupid characters, don't watch. If you despise plots that try to be deep and symbolic and fail, absolutely never pick this one up. The hype around this show was pointless, and failed to meet expectations.
