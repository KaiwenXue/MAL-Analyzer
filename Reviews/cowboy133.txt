Sometimes you'll watch it and be like "this episode sucks" and other ones will have you at the edge of your seat/couch. The antics of the main characters are hilarious but underneath their humerous appearance lay hidden secrets and sad pasts. Like most anime, it has it's action scenes and love scenes. It's worth watching if you can get past a few of the not so exciting episodes. But like I said, there's only a few that the series could do without. In the end howevere, it's worth

          
        watching.
