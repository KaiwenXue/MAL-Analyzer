i want to put my thoughts and feelings into words, after finishing Cowboy Bebop.

I started watching the show, due to the overwhelming ratings and positive reviews. Unfortunally i put it on hold after watching the first two episodes. My first thought was: "overrated". Just a story about some unlucky bounty hunters who were after some Woolongs.

A couple of months later, i gave the Bebop another chance and oh boy i'm so glad that i did. As the show progresses, you begin to understand the crew and you want them to succed in every misery they are put in. The character development is great

          
        and it propels the dynamic of the crew to new hights. Moreover, if you want to fall in love with a ficitional character, than look no further than Faye. She's just amazing.

The moment that made me fall in love with the show was at the end of "A Ballad of Fallen Angels". The excellent music, the cinematography, the introduction of a vicious villan and the jaw dropping action was enough to get me fully on board.

Does the show has it flaws? Of course! However, the exceptional detail of every aspect in this world, the masterful introduction of new characters, the energetic soundtrack, the philosohpical moments, the great quotes and the believable acts from the main cast makes the show feel so damn real.

Finally i asked myself, what defines a masterpiece? My answer was: a show that leaves a deep impact within you, a show that propels your imagination, a show that made you cry, laugh and scream, a show that leaves you empty after i ends, and a show that will set a new scale for others to come. That's the reason why i will carry that weight and give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10.
