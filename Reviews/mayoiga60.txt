The characters seem a bit stupid. No one asks Koharun how she got to that place, she just comes walking around. The thing about nanaki is confusing, like  how the people at Nanaki village could all see Reiji even if he wasn't their nanaki. The conclusion was much worse than I expected. The last few episodes were a little boring and the last episode was rushed.

Art 7/10
The art was decent. I liked the fog effects but most of the nanaki were not very "anime like" compared to the monsters in other animes. The characters were pretty good.

Sound 7/10
The audio of the last episode

          
        was out of sync and messed up. Opening and ending like typical anime openings and endings, nothing really special. The best audio part probably the hippo song kyaaa~

Character 5/10
Mitsume seems way too gullible. There are too many characters and most of them aren't really necessary. Many of them lack common sense. For example, Nettaiya brought high heels because she said the only shoes she had were high heel. Seriously, can't she just go buy some shoes that are more fit for walking? 

Enjoyment 7/10
The cliffhangers were really exciting. The whole anime itself could have been much better. Koharun's motive behind bringing all these people into Nanaki Village was pretty interesting. It was also pretty interesting how Lion said she knows when people are about to die, except that the anime didn't really go into that.

Overall 6/10
Mayoiga was pretty confusing overall. If there were less characters it would have been much better.
