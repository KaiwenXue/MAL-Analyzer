            
    Okay, I may be a bit suspicious to talk about the work, maybe I overdid it in the notes, no, I do not believe that, but okay, I'll start
I love this anime a lot, and it's funny how I get myself thinking about the work, about the different themes covered and, of course, the sad but great ending, the end of the series really complies with the word, it's an end, you feel complete , May have a taste of want more, but to see that the 26 episodes were satiating
The universe of Cowboy Bebop is very well built, it is already a time when

          
        space exploration worked, year 2071 (Unfortunately that year there will be no colony by the Solar System), Bounty Hunters earn a living in this new profession, In a new way of living
The art, as well as other animes of the 90's is fantastic, I find incredible the air that these styles bring, movements, in the action scenes are mainly fluid, and even the expressions of characters fascinate, this looking at every detail of scene, Without mentioning the very good animation that heaven possesses
The music is something else the fantastic part, starting from the opening, Tank! Like other songs that play during the series, and that curiously has a style of Jazz well pulled for the Bebop, and the fantastic music of closing, The Real Folk Blues, same name of the last two episodes, in addition the name of the episodes always has the See with music, and this is too interesting
And what to talk about the characters, my every character very well built, you play a character, and with the passing of the episodes you will know more of each one, the characteristic past of each and what is good, the outcome, Episode for episode You know each character, and I come to talk about the specific episodes of Jet and Faye, first Jet's, which are very engaging and serious, I love the rhythm of these episodes, Faye's, to know about her past Is very good, and I see that these specific episodes of Faye kind of sad because the history of her past is, I will not comment anything, if you want to know you have to watch, not to mention the other main characters like Spike that is a great Protagonist and Ed who is the hyperactive child, can not dislike it, in fact, there is no way to dislike anyone, even Ein, the dog is super charismatic (but I think all dogs are) secondary characters Which appear, such as Andy, Appledelhi (I think is the strongest character in the anime) and Tongpu (His story is very interesting)
The Rhythm of the anime really runs very well, I recommend it to everyone ..........
