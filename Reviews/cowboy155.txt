            
    This is my First Review! I never watched anime until i took an anime film course last semester and for our research paper we had to choose an anime series. I chose the show Cowboy Bebop as ive heard of its praise, and i was blown away. I was so impressed by the characters, the inner struggles and backstory of Spike, Jet, and Faye and watching them grow and develop was so engaging, the narrative structure was complex and refreshing and it was just so Stylish! from the opening all the way to the end. i wasnt even a fan of jazz until i watched

          
        this show, the jazz/blues theme plays through every scenario in the show and compliments the characters and visuals very well. Cowboy bebop so far is the most Complete story ive seen and i am constantly recommending it to people that refuse to watch anime because they say "its just cartoons", let them watch this they will be impressed. I am now addicted to anime and have watched a couple of shows since this and im glad i was introduced to a whole new genre of tv and film. By the way you will get hooked on the soundtrack so here are some of the names of the songs you will download.
