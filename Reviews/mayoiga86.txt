I did not enjoy Mayoiga. See, I don't even know what I just watched so I'll try my best to point out its positives and negatives.

Pros
+ Art
+ Opening (This show is unworthy of such a nice song)
+ First Episode (Sets up what could have been something interesting)
+ Comedy (Dont let the genre tags fool you. This show is definitely a comedy)

Cons
- Too many characters or at least, too many irrelevant/underused characters
- Terrible absolutely dreadful Characters/characterization  (EXECUTE GIRL, BB MEOW GIRL, and THAT STUPID COUPLE!!!!)
- Horrible Story (Nanaki? Really?)
- OST (wait...was there even an OST? I was too busy laughing the entire time)
-

          
        Animation (The CGI old lady. Oh god, my eyes)

Overall this show was really bad. By episode five, I was just forcing myself to watch it, hoping all the characters would just die. I think thats why everyone was still watching the show by ep 5. 

I highly recommend this show, however, for you lads who like to get drunk and watch stuff with friends. This show is perfect for you.


Episode rule: Don't watch it unless you're drunk with friends
