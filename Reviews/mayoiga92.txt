I was hooked from first reading the plot description and thus was confused by the poor rating and mixed reviews. I still do not understand why the rating is so low. Mayoiga had me constantly guessing the entire time--it took all 12 episodes to wrap up the mystery, which I found to be quite compelling and thrilling. The premise initially seemed fairly original to me, but developed into something more complex and much more enjoyable. I found myself on the edge of

          
        my seat during the entire duration of the show due to the pacing and unpredictability. I would have loved to have seen the backstories of all 30 characters, as the ones shown added to the characters' complexity and made me more sympathetic to some particularly annoying characters. While the main characters occasionally lacked depth and seemed rather annoying at points, the relationships of the side characters and unpredictability of the show's direction drove me to keep watching. The music gave the show the right mood and added to the unsettling vibe. I don't usually like creepy shows, but the innocent animation style and comical actions of the characters made the occasional gruesome monsters and creepy soundtrack digestible. If you're looking for a thrilling mystery that you won't see coming (you really will not anticipate the direction of this show at all, but unlike other reviewers, I really enjoyed it) I highly recommend Mayoiga!
