I think most of Cowboy Bebop's characters are boring and never change throughout the series with the exception of Faye Valentine.

I think the story is ignored for most of the run time leading to a rushed and messy ending.

I think the villain is shallow and overrated.

I only enjoyed a few of the episodes since most of the stories told didn't interest me.

I think the (English) voice acting is overrated with the exception of Faye Valentine, again.

The artwork and soundtrack is pretty good and there were a few

          
        moments where I was like, wooah.

But hey, a lot of people love and praise this show so there's no reason why you reading this wouldn't enjoy it too.

If you are the kind of person who thinks their opinions are facts, maybe don't. That's the message I want to put across in this review of mine.
