      
    It's a psychological & mystery anime? I'm pretty sure I was watching comedy. An anime where you pray that the MC would just die.

Story (1/10): Just like everyone says. It's so bad that's it's funny.

Art (9/10): It has a pretty good character design. I like the colors.

Sound (6/10): Sounds decent. The ambient music? Ehh... Not so great. This plays a
major role when making horror & psychological genre. It didn't get me at all. OP and ED sounds good.

Character (1/10): Most of the characters don't make any sense most of the time(except the detective one) They're horrible, you'll find yourself praying for the death of the

          
        MC because he's annoying asf.

Enjoyment (8/10): it's funny despite being a horror/mystery/psychological anime. 

Overall (2/10): If you're in to this kind of genre. I would say don't bother wasting your time. You could watch it if you aren't really serious.
