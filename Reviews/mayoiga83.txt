First, let me explain why the plot is a waste of time. At the beginning of the episode, we get an introduction of the characters. Typical, right? But After the conflict had been introduced, it turns out it wasn't the real conflict after all. They kept changing the story to the point that the sequence of events no longer made sense. It was full of plot

          
        holes and rushed events that it makes me wonder if the whole anime was just rushed or something.

Next, let's look at the characters. Again, the introduction at the beginning was just for show. Heck, I don't even remember most of the cast. There were too many characters of no importance and those who do serve for the plot only do so for the sake of it. Yes, there were many memorable characters, but they'll only be mascots to this anime to be honest.

Did I enjoy myself? Absolutely not. Actually, I didn't even know why I bothered to watch it all the way to the end. Little to no character developments, duplication of personalities, use of tropes, and many more are the reasons why I don't recommend it to those looking for interesting anime. But if you wanna watch it, go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't get lost in the plot of Mayoiga.

(Still gave it a 5/10 because I looked at the anime as a whole, from beginning to end, episode to episode, etc.)
