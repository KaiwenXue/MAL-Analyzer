OK, just finished ep.12 and was ready to wrap this series up with the next one only to realize that THAT WAS the last one...hmm. Don't normally write reviews, but I just have to say something about this.

I was originally intrigued by the concept! Bunch of people needing to seek out a mysterious village. Things look like they get a little crazy for them. Maybe, this will be good mindtrip. So I started to watch and it drew me in, but then it ended, one or two episodes early IMO. I even backed out to double check, there weren't anymore. Then, I realized,

          
        I didn't really care anyways. That's how I felt after this show.

The show was just BLAND on all aspects. Like eating plain Corn Flakes, then saying afterward "Shoulda put some banana and sugar in it." 

Sadly, I really believe Mayoiga had so much more potential. It needed more depth to the mystery, more intense psychological drama, and definitely better execution on the chuckles it tried to throw in.

FYI, my overall 6 is more like a high 5 rounded up. Now, I can't say "SKIP Mayoiga, its a total friggin waste of time!", but I can say if you're really hungry, well there's Corn Flakes.
