When I started to watch the show, I felt compelled by the mystery. With every new episode I kept wondering what was going on. Why do those things happen? What does it all mean? 
Yet, as many others already wrote, the rather interesting story was carried out in the most boring way possible. It could have been way more. 
Watching the one-dimensional characters act like total imbeciles really ruins any emotional attachment one might have

          
        had. In my opinion, everything about this show kinda fits together and paints a really shallow picture.
The characters would have been really bad in any other show, but they kind of fit here, as they each represent certain aspects. They are not so much meant to be human than ideas which could have turned out really well if only the show were to evoke some questions.
Some interesting main characters aren't discussed in the slightest (e.g. Nanka, the detective).
But through all of it's weak ponts, it somehow fits. Mayoiga manages to form a Scenery out of it's music, characters and plot. It isn't a bad anime. It would have been rather good, if it just asked some questions instead of answering everything. Make the viewers think!

I did not waste my time on this, but I probably wouldn't suggest it to anyone either.
By the way: am I the only one who thinks of Mayoiga as some darker and stranger version of Angel Beats? :)
