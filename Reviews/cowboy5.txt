The first 20 or so episodes are pretty much random bounty hunting episodes then near the end of the series they try to throw in some ridiculous plot involving a &quot;Syndicate&quot;. The animation and art was subpar, the sound and music were very nice though. Overall Cowboy Bebop is disappointing and very much a forgettable series. If you want to see a good series from Cowboy Bebop's director Shinichiro Watanabe check out Samurai Champloo
