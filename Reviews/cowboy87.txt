It will take you by surprise, by how the story travels, how the characters relate, how the story is or the best of all, how the awesome sound gels with the story and give it a high value. I prefer this to any anime newcomer and I don't deny it will take them as a surprise.

Story: 8/10

The first few episodes you will feel like, is there any story at all. But I bet, it is, and damn what a story it is.

          
        At first glance, it is just another bounty hunter in alternate universe, but it so much more than that. And it is hard to explain without giving spoilers, so I contain myself not to reveal, but it is one hell of a story.

Art: 8/10

I was quite awestruck with the art style. Can't believe it came a decade ago, but nonetheless, it is refreshing. It is far better than lot of crap, that is being aired these days.

Sound: 9/10

One of the best OST in anime,I have ever heard. Don't go by my Anime List, I have heard a lot and it is easily one of the best. I seriously doubt this show would have received such accolades if not for the OST.

Character: 8/10

Characters are unique yet not so hard to understand. Each of the have nice back story which unfold over time. And all of them all excellent and it cruise along with the story. It compliments the story and does great job.

Enjoyment: 9/10

Damn, this anime has everything. Humor, Action and what not. I thoroughly enjoyed it and except a couple of filler episodes, I was totally blasted away with the show. I binge-watched the show after certain episode. as I couldn't wait any longer. It is seriously addictive.

Overall: 8/10

I enjoyed watching the show. Do I recommend it? Yes.
