And yes, I can appreciate, some of the thematic undertones, relating to personal demons explored in the later episodes of the show, if you don't fall for the characters emotionally, something I imagine is extremely subjective, it may be a little harder to watch, that is less addictive, than other shows with a little more in the way of consistent narrative progression.
