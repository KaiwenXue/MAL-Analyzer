Great message Appalling Execution

This anime started off with a lot of hype but went downhill faster than Love-pon screams "Exectuion!" 

Story is full of plot holes, and I could not stand the characters and their attitudes. The story was also rushed into 13 episodes which should have been 26. The quality of the overall storytelling went so low, that I started to find it humorous. Like really? You are traumatized by Silicon Gel because you put breast implants in your head? Are you f***ing serious? I hope the authors were having fun writing this piece of crap, cause

          
        I cannot imagine then writing it with a serious face.

Most of the animations were CG and it did not match with the "hand - drawn" animations. The character designs were so generic , and I could probably forget what they looked like a year later.

The sound was not bad but was not good. There wasn't a soundtrack that caught my attention.

Ah, Enjoyment.. man every f***ing character pissed me off to the point where it became funny, and I thought I was watching a comedy.
