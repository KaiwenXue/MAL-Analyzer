    People who know me know that I'm not a fan of episodic anime series unless they're either one season (12-14 episodes) long or a slice of life series. Why? They have a tendency to get boring, or repetitive. But all rules and preferences have exceptions. You know what? Cowboy Bebop is that exception.

The story is set in a space western setting - a genre and setting I'm loving more and more for each show I watch that falls under the genre. We follow two bounty hunters, Spike and Jet, who own a ship called the Bebop. They travel the Solar system, chasing wanted criminals to

          
        earn money. Along the way, they also pick up two women; the debt-laden Faye Valentine and the playful kid and computer genius Edward (yes, Ed&rsquo;s a girl). 

Each episode brings about a new bounty which they chase after, and while that doesn't sound too exciting to watch 26 episodes in a row, you'll end up loving the show. All the different events makes for a certain degree of unpredictability, and you'll sometimes wonder how things will end. However, that alone is not enough to give the story the rating I've given it. So why have I given that rating? Let's continue...

One of the things that elevate the show a bit above the rest is the manner in which the main cast's pasts are explored. It's not like one flashback episode and you understand everything about how they are today. In one episode you might get one piece, and then the next one in another episode, and it's not until the final three episodes of the show that everything falls in place. This way of executing it makes you want to watch another episode, so that you can find out more about the characters (some may say that this falls in under &quot;Character&quot;, but the manner in which the pasts are explored are more &quot;Story&quot; than &quot;Character&quot;, IMO). Now, that's so far a 9 for the story. Why did it deserve a 10?

The answer is easy: the way they executed many scenes in the show. The contrasts which you get to see between, music, the setting of scenes and what's really happening just gives the story that extra edge deserving of a perfect score.

The characters are all really good and interesting fellows. Though they every now and then reminded me of characters from other shows, they preserved that originality which gave a feel that they were, if not completely, then at least a little bit more real than most characters out there. The way their pasts intertwine with the future and how everything ends with them confronting and settling open ends from their pasts is also something that's impressive to watch. I don't really have anything more to say than &quot;perfect&quot;.

The animation is, for a 90s anime, stunningly good. The detail put into backgrounds and surroundings is really good, and I also love how good lighting effects and shading are at times. All of Ed&rsquo;s strange movements are animated really nicely too. If there's something negative, it's the somewhat dull coloring (compared to today's standards), as well as poor effects when traveling in hyperspace.

The soundtrack is also astounding! The music used for the show is so incredibly varied, and while keeping mostly to the more jazzy tunes, the soundtrack visits so many genres that it's hard to not like at least a few pieces. What I also loved is the way the music was used not only as a medium to go with and amplify the mood, but also as a contrast to what's happening in several scenes. All in all, it's really amazing. Don't have anything to say against voice acting and other sound effects either.

All in all Cowboy Bebop is an anime that&rsquo;s in the top tier on the greatness scale, and a show I believe every anime fan should give a try.

To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)

    Cowboy Bepop.

There's something about this anime that sets itself apart from everything else out there. From its amazing atmosphere to its near-flawless character design, this anime is a surefire way to make a boring weekend a lot less boring. I had heard so much about this show from many different sources, but I had never tried to watch it. Only because of a sudden urge to watch anime was I able to fully grasp how good this show is.

Let me just say that the intro is definitely something to drool over like some mindless fanboy. And I don't say that often. A good intro may

          
        not affect the story, but it can really draw in viewers.

Take a look for yourself (Don't worry, it's just an intro. No spoilers here. I DO have a heart, you know.)

SOUND:

9/10

The soundtrack really is unique, and I haven't seen anything else quite like it. It can go from smooth and classy to quick and dangerous in a matter of a few seconds and you wouldn't know what hit you. The soundtrack alone is a good reason why you should watch this anime.

ART:

9/10

As for the art? It might be a bit outdated, but... you know, that's because it came out in 1998. But even for its release date, it showed an exceptional amount of care and passion. The little details were what drew me in, not to mention the downright awesome fight scenes. It's clear there was a lot of dedication that went into this anime and I applaud the makers. Kudos. 

STORY: (Obvious spoilers.)

10/10

While the story might seem everywhere to some people, it's clearly meant to be that way. Each story arc offered a unique setting and progression. From an intelligent dog comparable to a human being to a pathogen bomb that has the ability to wipe out an entire population on a planet, you're in for a ride, folks. But I don't want to spoil any more for you. Just know that you'll be missing out if you don't watch this anime.

CHARACTERS: (Yes. Take all of my virtual yes.)

The character design and progression is something I rarely see in shows nowadays, excluding some of the more successful shows out there. Those are successful for a reason. I particularly love the smooth personality of the main character, and the uncle-like friendliness (While still possessing copious amounts of badassary) of his companion. There are a few more notable characters, but I'll leave them to you to discover.

ENJOYMENT?:

Yes. I enjoyed it. If you haven't already figured that out, then you have now. 10/10, would fangasm over again.

Nuff' said, really.

OVERALL:

10/10.

Watch this anime. You won't regret it.

    I hazard to award any series a full-blown ten, as I see the ranking more as a place to compare everything else to than an actual spot where anything belongs. Unless it's Cowboy Bebop...

The episodic structure gradually reveals more and more about the characters while bouncing between tones and still being able to be taken as seriously or silly as it wants. With a plot that isn't exceptionally complicated, the pacing and delivery manages to make it exceptionally compelling. 

The visual style screams "cool" with fights given loving attention and characters moving around and interacting with interesting worlds. 

The music...
Sublime standing by itself, the Seatbelts

          
        blend of jazzy cool, contemporary mixes, and some American cowboy couldn't be imitated and hasn't been done since. 

 The characters are excellently portrayed and acted, with personalities that are crystal clear and enjoyable to watch. I honestly can't think of much else to say that won't come across as gushing; they're superb!

This series blew so many standard prejudices I had against anime out of the water. Here is an anime, where less is more. Less talking, less byzantine plots, less tacked-on elements, just tons of atmosphere and personality. Truly the bearer of the cup of which to baptize neophyte western Otaku, Cowboy Bebop is a series I cherish to revisit alone and with friends, and plan to do so for many years to come. 

Now I just have to wait for one of those $300+ blue-ray collections to fall into my lap and get Steve Blum to sign it...

    Cowboy Bebop, is a masterpiece. Anybody who argues otherwise quite obviously doesn't understand the medium. Cowboy bebop is one of the few shows out there that exists so highly in so many people's lists that it has become like a reference point all other anime is graded out of. 
*Person 1* So I just finished Tokyo Weeabho-I mean ghoul.
*Person 2* Hmm, how many Bebops out of 10 was it?
*Person 1* Eh, 2-3.
*Person 2* This analogy is getting old!
But I think you understand what I mean.

Let me start with the story, a lot of people could argue that CB is just a bunch of filler, and

          
        while they might technically be right, all the filler there serves the purpose of supplying character development which makes the story make sense. It all ties in and that is wonderful.

Art? Pfft, more like heaven's gloriously profound image of god we just found lying around on Toonami one day.

Sound?
2 words, Yoko Kanno.
Done. 
NEXT!

Character development as I stated earlier is an integral element of this, as is Yoko Kanno's stunningly jazzy soundtrack and this is one of the few anime out there that rivals NGE in terms of character depth an portrayal.
Character development is defined as
"the change a character undergoes during the course of a story"
And in most stories this would apply to character that goes from point A (Us knowing nothing about them) to point B (Us knowing something about them)
But in Bebop they handle it a bit... Smoother, because there are no time stamps at which we know more about them per se.
I will just say, like Spike's famous fighting style... It's smooth like water.

The enjoyment is so far through the roof I can see the toys in the attic, it's just a fun show.
Overall Bebop is an absolute masterpiece that needs to be seen by anybody and everybody, even people who don't like anime.
Watch it and enjoy, it's a wild ride.


See you, space cowboys ;)

    What to say about this anime that hasn't already been said?
I finished CB not so long ago, and it quickly became my favorite anime so far, and for very good reasons. 

Story: 9/10
The storytelling in this anime is one of its crowning achievements. It follows the crew of the Bebop and their struggle to make a living out of bounty hunting, showing a different "case" in almost every episode. There's a criminal on the loose, they go out to get him, at some point things go wrong (no wonder there's a recurrent theme of luck/lack of luck in this show) and after all they've done

          
        they either get a very small bounty, waste it all in one day, or get nothing at all. It sounds comical and even repetitive, but trust me, it's not. And that's because CB is a character-driven show - each of this "cases" serve to reveal a thing or two about the main characters, and how they deal with their past, which is, for most of them, pretty tragic. The "main" plot, however, is focused on Spike Spiegel, his forbidden romance, his downfall and his ascension. And it is beautifully done. It doesn't rely on clichs to get an emotional reaction out of you, it does not spoonfeed you with everything you need to know, it follows the "show, don't tell" rule to a tee... BUT exactly because of that it can also be a little slow in the beginning, so you have to be aware of that when you decide to watch it.

Characters: 9/10
The one word I can say to describe the characters in Cowboy Bebop is REAL. They look and feel real. My biggest surprise was Faye Valentine. At first she looks like a shallow woman who's willing to do anything to survive, but as the plot progresses and you get to know her past, you notice how complex she actually is. I was only a little disappointed with the lack of focus given to Ed, who could've been a little more developed, and Julia, who felt to me was just there to be Spike's love interest. Vicious, the main villain, also felt a bit clich. Apart from that, most of the characters, including Spike, of course, are brilliant and very well developed. And I'm not talking only about the main characters. A lot of the side characters are also very interesting and memorable.

Art: 10/10
This anime was made in 1998, and it has better art than many anime from the 2010's. This is certainly something. The animation is incredibly fluid, the colors are spot on... I really have no complaints AT ALL in this area.

Sound: 10/10
CB's soundtrack is one of its most famous aspects, and rightly so. It's very unique and varied, with songs ranging from jazz to bossa nova (!). Yoko Kanno's score brings personality to a very music-oriented show, making an already memorable scene become even more memorable. I still listen to some of the songs in this soundtrack daily. That's how good it is. 

Enjoyment: 9/10
Like I mentioned before, Cowboy Bebop has a rather slow start. But it gets better, and even at its most "boring" moments, it has a level of intrigue that will make you come back to it and eventually enjoy it a lot. It's definitely a very rewatchable show, and it gives a lot of "food for thought" too. 

Overall, there's nothing else for me to say about this anime. It's a MASTERPIECE, in every sense of the word, and a definite must-watch for anime fans, and even for those who don't like anime. 
Cowboy Bebop is a 10/10!

See You Space Cowboy!

    After all these years, I've finally watched Cowboy Bebop. And I have a great time.

Cowboy Bebop is a classic into the anime world of 26 episodes, Aired in 1996 by the studio Sunrise.
He was aired in 1996. 1996. Yes it's the third time I write it, but it was an important detail, because I was so amazed by the animation !

So the first point: the draws and the animation. It's one of these rare pearl in this field.
It's dynamic, clean, and precise. And God knows we needed this to follow these bounty hunters ! 
I though have already saw all about 90's japanimation, but this

          
        anime surprised me, really a good job.
There is CGI sometimes, but not a nuisance, pretty well-mastered.

The second striking point for me are the OST. Or do I call them, Insert Song? The large majority of the OST are  already know famous jazz song, it sets a unique atmosphere, very interesting.
It's by the way the anime slogan "the work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop" and after finished watch the anime, I think they are true.
Oh and the opening James Bond's style is awesome!

Characters are endearing. Excepted Ed who, for me, is here for scenaristic readiness.
They all have 2 or 3 episodes about their past and other, and it's largely enough.

When I heard about this anime, I though that it was very serious, dark, and take itselfs too seriously. But hey, humour was here too! And is probably the most revelant side of this anime.
3-4 Boundy Hunters so poor that they can't eat and have to hunt all the time.
Plus, interactions between characters are hilarous!

So, why only 9 ?
The problem, for me, comes from the genre itselfes. 
The serie are composed of stand alone episodes. And I didn't really like that. It was cool the first part of the serie, but after, you're awaiting for a show which tell something ! And all elements was here: Endearing characters with tragic past, OST, atmosphere.
But no, there is only a few episodes about their past dispersed through all the serie. I think it's too bad.

But to conclude, this serie is fun, with an unique atmosphere, excellent OST, endearing characters and perfect 90's animation. A Masterpiece. Hurry on it !

    Cowboy Bebop is considered by many to be one of the best and with good reason.

First of all, Keiko Nobumato (writer of Cowboy Bebop) should feel proud for creating such a wonderful cast of characters.  The show is set in the distant future and follows the many exploits of a crew of bounty hunters.  The shows central character is Spike Spiegel, a young man whos slow to exhibit emotion yet quick to rush into danger.  His partner is Jet Black, an x-cop who seems to be the wiser of the two.   Faye Valentine, a strong, confident female bounty hunter, joins

          
        the crew a few episodes in, followed several episodes later by a young, energetic kid named Ed, who at first I thought would just end up being an utter annoyance.  Instead, she succeeded on many occasions to bring a smile to my face.  What Nobumato did here was give his viewers a cast of  characters they will never forget.  Whether it be their constant arguing, incessant bantering, or occasional sympathizing, seeing these misfits interact with one another is reason enough to watch.                            

Though there isn't much in terms of an overlying plot, most of Cowboy Bebops 26 episodes wont fail to satisfy, with plot lines ranging from truly heart-warming to downright dark and dreary.  Instead of bombarding viewers with plot twist after plot twist, Nobumato decided to utilize a different kind of twist.  Throughout the series, he reveals bits and pieces about the characters lives before becoming bounty hunters, stuff that the other characters didn't even know.  Its these episodes where Cowboy Bebop really shines, especially the ones dealing with Spike and a mysterious man by the name of Viscous, the only truly recurring villain in the show.  Though not much concrete is provided about their past relations, their scenes together are some of the highest emotional points of the series.

Unfortunately, I have little  time left to tell you about Bebops slick, stylish fight scenes as well as its robust soundtrack, a great mix of country, jazz, and rock n roll.  Because of all this and the shows wonderfully endearing cast, I see no reason why you shouldn't check it out.  I honestly think it's one of the most broadly appealing Anime around.

Visual Style- A great example of just how amazing a Japanese Anime can look, all the while never letting the animations get too ridiculous.

Sound- The Japanese voice-acting is superb, and the soundtracks mix of country, jazz, and rock works surprisingly well.

Characters- The amazing cast and their many scenes together make the entire experience well worth it.

Plot- Theres really no overlying plot, but most of the episodes still manage to pull you in, especially the ones dealing with the characters pasts.  Some of the episodes do end quite abruptly though.

Lasting Appeal- A wonderful accomplishment that will stick with you for years to come.  Truly one of the best.

    This is to the people who give high rated anime low scores and fill their reviews with SUBJECTIVE opinions.

I think most of Cowboy Bebop's characters are boring and never change throughout the series with the exception of Faye Valentine.

I think the story is ignored for most of the run time leading to a rushed and messy ending.

I think the villain is shallow and overrated.

I only enjoyed a few of the episodes since most of the stories told didn't interest me.

I think the (English) voice acting is overrated with the exception of Faye Valentine, again.

The artwork and soundtrack is pretty good and there were a few

          
        moments where I was like, wooah.

But hey, a lot of people love and praise this show so there's no reason why you reading this wouldn't enjoy it too.

If you are the kind of person who thinks their opinions are facts, maybe don't. That's the message I want to put across in this review of mine.

    As a guy who only recently started having real interest in anime I've tried to create a list of very good animes to start my anime quest and set a good standard, and Cowboy Bebop is certainly one that will be remembered by me for many years to come. 

Nobody I knew watched it, I had no idea of what to expect, except for a good soundtrack, and it was all a new experience to me. I'm usually more interested in fantasy stuff, with superpowers or supernatural beings, but I certainly did not miss that while watching Cowboy Bobop. 

At first glance Spike was the

          
        skinny guy with weird hair who tried to look cool and just looked bored most of the time and Jet was the strong guy who had to make up for his partner's laziness and do most of the thinking, but this was not the case. As the seemingly completely disconnected episodes pass, we get to see much more of their pasts and what led them to become what they are now, and it does not happen over 1 or 2 episodes and bam, you know eveything, it builds up from episode to episode, finding out bit by bit about everyone's past. 

Faye Valentine and "Radical" Ed are the other 2 members of the Bebop's 4 people crew (not forgetting about the lovely dog named Ein). Faye is a woman that can really take care of herself (most of the times) and has an easy time losing all her money through bad gambling or being held at gunpoint by strange people. Ed is a really weird girl who happens to work much better with her computer than with people, but she is an interesting character whose naivety and disconnection with the situations actually play for her. 

I personally liked the second part of the 26 episodes more. Perhaps it took a few episodes for the characters to build on me? The combination of excellent jazzy soundtrack with unexpected situations and people you don't know very well engaging in unique bounty hunting from episode to episode on different places of the solar system is something you will probably love or hate. I loved it, and the last episode surely made me shed one manly tear (okay, 2 tears).

    I'm not a big fan of episodic anime. I'm also not really a fan of the werstern genre. 

The thing about Bebop is that it is in fact a classic. I can see that. In the same way I am not a big fan of classical music but can recognize the brilliance of Motzart, I can see that Bebop has its merits. 

The story and the characters work very well together. It feels like an anime version of Firefly (which personally I'd also right at about a 7). 

The thing is that, it wasn't really thrilling to me. The lack of a real long term

          
        plot didn't really invest me in the characters. The characters felt deep and well-developed, and each episode individually wasn't bad, but the thing about episodic anime to me is that they can't really reach a climax. Even though Bebop's end climax was solid, it is different than watching characters change and struggle on a journey to reach the approaching peak. Bebop was sort of everyday living in this new world, then story resolution at the end kind of. 

I enjoyed it. It was solid storytelling, good characters. But I just can't get behind the universal praise Bebop receives. It's good, but no masterpiece.

    Cowboy Bebop is considered a masterpiece of an anime nowadays, and it was one of the first anime recommended to me when I started getting into anime. I was excited to get into the series, but that excitement unfortunately did not last. About halfway through the series, I had to keep forcing myself to watch another episode just so I could finish the series (I don't like stopping in the middle of a show), but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's just start with the story.

There is no story. This is an episodic series, which isn't a problem in its own right, but isn't something

          
        I'm typically into. I prefer overarching plots that tell one cohesive story. However, I have enjoyed episodic series before, so I kept watching. I quickly got bored of the repetitive plots. The villains of each episode were hardly interesting because they didn't get enough time to do anything. That really goes for all the characters except for the core 4. There is never enough time to develop anything enough to the point where I actually care. The individual stories are fine on their own, but they just felt like a drag to get through together. I'll give a 6/10 since I did enjoy a good number of them, but the ones that I didn't just felt like a chore to sit and watch through.

I'm putting art and sound together because they are both fantastic, and it's hard to talk about one without the other. The animation is consistently fast and fluid, and the directing is amazing. The music almost always goes perfectly with each scene its in, and the OP of the whole series is one of the most catchy openings I've listened to. The dub of this series is also great, with each voice actor doing an amazing job for their respective characters. Both get a 9.

Now onto my main complaint, the characters. The core four characters, Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward are all very well developed, and I enjoyed watching them (except for Ed, she got annoying fast). The problems come with everyone else. As I've already said, none of them get the time they need for me to actually care about them. They have to establish the characters, and then, in the same episode, wrap up their stories, and that just isn't enough time. Spike, Jet and Faye were all great and well developed characters, but they are the only ones who I cared about in the entire series, so 4/10.

My enjoyment level for this series continued to go down with each episode. It felt like a chore to watch another episode, which is why it took me four months to finish this series. It did have some really great moments, and the action in the series was consistently very good. I can definitely see why this show got its cult status, it just wasn't for me. I'll give this another 4 for enjoyment, and overall I'd give it a 7/10.

    "Cowboy Bebop is a generally overrated Anime that now is mostly famous due to its continues element of referencing Western pop culture, high-quality OST and well animated action sequences, however doesnt offer neither too much in actual substance nor actual characterization worth mentioning in its episodic narrative". 

This aforementioned statement has more or less become the popular opinion regarding Cowboy Bebop, a highly popular Anime TV-series, whichs first episode aired in April 1998. Being part of the "trio" with both Trigun and Berserk (excluding the heavily controversial Evangelion for now), its one of the first Anime-series which did grow a considerable large fanbase in the

          
        West in the 90s, without being a Fighting-Shounen aired on evenings time like DBZ or essentially being a Mahou-Shoujo like Sailor Moon is. Naturally, a show with Bebops setting, style and overload of original soundtracks in English was bound to appeal to a Western audience at least in some way and as time stands, Bebop managed to stay stronger as its two brothers in arms trying to conquer hearts of potential Western fans for a long time now and established itself as a somewhat cult-cartoon, even only be it in the US. However, as time progressed and Anime become much more popular caused by online streaming, heavily increasing the knowledge and accessibility of numerous different titles, the show did tend fall out of peoples favourites of both casual Anime watchers and fans of critically acclaimed Anime with surprisingly common reasoning, especially because the things Ive mentioned in the first paragraph. As much as I think that some of these statements have at least a grain of truth in them (while I take them with a grain of salt), theyre either minor criticism or undermining the huge power it has in both its overarching theme-exploration and its ingenious use of an episodical narrative, not taking away any quality from it, but rather carve it in stone. Even though a lot of people are not digging each show of the aforementioned trio for some totally legitimate reasons, its almost impossible to take away the most important aspect within each of them, landing a much bigger hit on a more mature audience, than the other popular Anime during these times did. Berserks slow, but superb incorporation dark, fantastical elements into its gritty medieval setting, Triguns good balance of comedy and darker story elements and Cowboy Bebopswell Im about to show you my personal take on this series qualities, as I try to play along those lines of its Jazz.


1. Pushing The Sky


Being listed as one of the most influential "Space-Western" up until this day, the setting of Bebop hovers both lots of potential to either exceed peoples expectations, or to majorly disappoint them when looking for the wrong thing, namely the show being a Space-Opera in a classic sense, inevitably hinting at Legend of the Galactic Heroes. As the series prolongs, its more of a mixture of multiple genres, which evidently can have a quite diverse feeling to them. For example, "slice of life"-esque episodes are getting mixed in with clearly experimental episodic stories + storytelling. By stating that fact, its even more remarkable that the series is able to pull off these kinds of tone-shifts with such ease and fluency, while still providing something of value for each individual episode, be it in story-telling, character-insight or excellently creative directing, a challenge most Anime not only have trouble accomplishing to begin with, but dont even come close to the quality it facilitated. 

The lack of a progressing story in Bebop is easily justified by it using the episodic-style to its absolute advantage, implementing a highly interesting factor for its characters among numerous other masterfully executed aspects, which will be tackled a little later in this review. While the series offers a kind of coherent main-storyline, which gets its first big reveal in episode 5, most of the other episodes have a tendency to classify themselves in one of two categories with partially fluent borders, while the first one dominates in prevalence: Either as an exploration and continuation of already introduced themes (f.e. the famous being stuck in time-conflict) like Waltz for Venus #8 or a refreshingly light-hearted, facetious and "tribute-paying" episode like Cowboy Funk #22. While the thematic value of each individual story might just vary for every viewer, these episodes have the capability to really hit hard and build up on already introduced conflicts, making it really questionable if those episodes really should be called mere side-stories to begin with, since their coherency in exploration is absolutely on par with the main one. 
Of course it helps, that competently executed episodic storytelling is often the cream of the crop Im searching for in this medium, upping the value of the series even more for me personally.

The Bebop crew visits different planets, gets engaged into different ship-battles, meets different people of different beliefs, kicks different villains butts and manages to pay homage to so many different titles of Western pop culture its insane. Starting with more obvious ones like Spikes incredibly similar style of fighting to Bruce Lee, which feels almost like a "flow of water", to minor references of Blade Runner (episode #7, character named Decker) and many more. I honestly dont want to list more of them, since Id be lying if I say that I did get them all by myself, but more importantly because this aspect has been endlessly covered already and being used to define the homages as one of its biggest strengths, while it only is a minor one. Its true that these aspects accompanied by the stylistic ass-kicking both the crew and their villains receive over the course of the series offer the simple assumption, that the show is not more than a merely rule-of-cool type of show, which has become some kind of tainted term in the anime community, at least from my perspective. Cowboy Bebop undeniably borrows a lot of rule-of-cool, however is able to provide much more than that, creating an immediate oxymoron going by its popular definition. Its more of a stylistic approach by the show's director Watanabe, or by Anime in general, to pay respect to both the popular action and the classical film noir genre in the West, creating both a unique and refreshing appearance in the Anime medium.


2. Words That We Couldnt Say (Major Spoilers ahead!)


Probably the second most important, or even the most important aspect why Bebop qualifies for all the praise it gets, is the handling of its cast with utmost care and competency. Combined with the ingenious audiovisual storytelling, its what the shows identity defines in hindsight. Without it, breaking the general idea behind almost every (non main-story related) epsiode apart is quite a breeze and would go something like this: 
1. The crew set their sight on a new high-reward bounty.
2. They make a plan on how to catch the bounty alive.
3. Something goes wrong, their target gets killed or escapes.
Of course this is, as mentioned before, a heavily watered-down version of how its episodic storytelling actually works and is functioning as a criticism, that is quite common to hear: The individual stories are too repetitive is one of these classic examples I tend to hear a lot, especially in recent times. It might be a legitimate reason to severely decrease ones enjoyment of a show, but wont work well as hitting criticism for the show, since the simplicity of said episodes served as just the right set-up to dive into the characters behaviour, which is connected deep within Bebops unarguable main thematic: All characters of the the crew suffer from not being able to advance in their own future, since theyre plagued by their past bringing them down. This becomes clearer the longer the series progresses, studying on how they firstly act as apathetic outsiders when confronted with stories and emotions of strangers (even their own bounty), but over the course of the episode they see them as projections of their own problems and happenings in the past, finally making them feel empathy and acting "out of character". Clear hints for that are scattered all over the series, for instance when the crew is letting their prey escape, Jet being lenient on Spike after their big dispute and then not even bringing in ther bounty, even when they would need the cash so desperately. 

Balancing all of these aspects undermines another big strength of Cowboy Bebop: It manages to convey all the aforementioned without ever feeling preachy or washy in its runtime. When looking on how well it all wrapped up, Watanabe just has to be the main suspect responsible for all the aspects to run like clockwork, displaying few hints here and there in several episodes, making effective use of subtext in dialogues, heavily including the OST in its storytelling and therefore finding the perfect balance between style and substance, Watanabe managed to fit it all in. 

Furtherly examining and putting singular characters into spotlight is a very interesting task in this series, especially when talking about the crew of bounty hunters themselves. 
When starting with the protagonist of the show, Spike Spiegel, we already found ourselves a true gem to analyze, probably even exceeding the other two incredibly interesting crew members of Bebop. Spike is a former member of the "Red-Dragon-Syndicate" and now an independent bounty hunter. A feud inside the syndicate, involving an only hinted triangle-conflict between Spike, Julia (Spikes light of love) and Vicious (the main antagonist) led to violent confrontations within the Syndicate, mainly involving Spike, Vicious and his adherents. Spike makes an (ultimately futile) attempt to fake his own death, Julia manages to flee and Vicious stays within the syndicate in an aspirational position. 

Spikes central-conflict of the show is exemplary for the very similar conflicts of his comrades: The inability of moving forward or changing his perception of life itself, because of him being tied to the crucial events of his past, even when absolutely trying to forget or starting to deny that said fact. Probably the most tragic one of the bunch, Spikes past does have the highest ability to come back for him and most cruel, just when he was able to move on it did strike its last fatal blow. Viciously being robbed of his loved one, the sole light in his past was the ultimate nail in the coffin for no return. The crows, both Vicious symbol and for all the hardships Spike has been through in this past and still clings upon to resolve, is an interesting thing to talk about, as theyre seen multiple times before Spike is engaged in battle with Vicious (episode #5 church scene) or a crow is shown waking Spike up from his dreams, after he was being shot by a subsequently revealed tranquilizer. Furtherly supporting the crisis Spike goes through during his journey, are the little bits we get to hear from the way hes talking to others about his past, clearly hinting at the happenings in the syndicate (I was killed once beforeby a woman) or his overall futile actions to resist being dragged down into stagnation from his backstory (It feels like Im watching a bad dream Ill never wake up from). 

Jet Black, the seemingly rather reserved "head of the crew, also gets explored rather fantastically, when thinking about how little screen time his conflicts did have in contrast to Spike and Faye. Jet is a former member of the ISSP (Inter System Solar Police), positioned at Ganymed (a moon of Jupiter). He joined the Bebop after he left the ISSP due to an incident, involving him losing one arm and had it replaced with a mechanical one.  Jet acts as an adequate counter-pole for Spike by comparing their past alone. But not only do they really differ in their backstory and journey to the Bebop, they also greatly differ in personality. While Jet still has not lost his ability to care for others not involved in his own backstory to that severe amount as the for example Spike did, his reserved deep care for his comrades also shows more through actions than through words. Albeit he frequently warns the crew from taking any reckless actions, he usually falls back into a played facade of apathy shortly afterwards. This attitude often dissolves with him doing someone a favour/kind gesture at the end of an episode, even though that someone usually disagreed with Jet's beliefs and plans. The interaction between Spike and Jet on the run to its finale is one of the most noteworthy examples of show dont tell, when talking about the atmosphere created by the audiovisuals, or one of the best examples of conveying emotions through simple dialogue and analogies Ive seen in the medium so far. 

Adding the third member to the bunch, a lot of people seem to prefer Fayes backstory over every other in Cowboy Bebop and they do so justly. While it might not be my personal favourite, since I found Spikes to be even more engrossing, Faye is the only member who goes through by the book development during her conquest to retrieve her lost memories.

Faye is 23 years old, cold-hearted on the surface, depraved and one clever and dangerous individual to be reckoned with despite her very femininely attractive physique. Over the course of the series we get to learn, that Fayes memories has been completely erased due to the 54-years long cryogenic sleep shes been put through. This cryogenic treatment was undertaken, in order to save her life by waiting until the medical technology was advanced as much to treat her fatal injuries, which wouldve caused her death back then. That functions as a very interesting setup to see Fayes actual development caused by the retrieval of her memories in bits and pieces, in contrast to Spike and Jets development basically finished before we jump into Bebops storyline. Furthermore, her chase after a place where she truly belongs does prove to be really difficult, since her relatives are nowhere to be seen and her former home planet Earth is now uninhabitable due to the devastation from numerous meteor strikes while she was sleeping and harbours an initial disdain towards the crew of bounty hunters. The show manages to explore the core-conflict splendidly, creating both heart-breaking moments (e.g. the end of episode #24 Hard Luck Woman) and a tremendously emotional climax out of the pretty basic setup, which ensnarls itself deeply with Spikes conflict in the concluding episodes. This might as well verify once again, that simplicity in a shows basic conflict can very well lead to superbly connected theme exploration, in Bebops case in a very subtle but discernible manner. I very much appreciate Watanabes attempt to neither try to look incredibly smart or complex at any point in its runtime as well, since it would take away large bits from the qualities Bebop set itself up through its overall rule-of-cool-ish style on the surface and subtle hints on the thematic depth of characters backstories. 

While Ed is lacking in the character-section theres an argument to be made, that she is not as important of a character, because of her lacking in character-depth in relatively to the rest of the bunch and that is entirely true when only talking about her as a character and not how her eventual farewell from the Bebop crew influences both Spike and Jet personally. While I can definitely agree on her lacking as a singular character in comparison, I simply cannot agree with the criticism, that theres a lack of character chemistery, since its the shows intention to make especially Spikes and Fayes relation to every crew-member as cold as impossible, as them being stuck in the past life and not being able to indulge themselves into new, close relations is basically the main theme of Bebop entirely. 


3. Gotta Knock A Little Harder


As fans of the series might have all already noticed, I tried to name my headers for each individual section of my review after actual songs in the Cowboy Bebop OST. While I tried to use it only as a creative and a bit more stylistic approach to properly segment my review, Bebop does not only use it stylistically or just to provide atmosphere, how virtually every other audiovisual medium tries to use it. No, it incorporates the music directly in its storytelling actively, leaving it to the tracks to tell a story, leaving it to the music to...convey a message. Yoko Kanno and her particularly for this occasion formed band The Seatbelts did create a total amount of 6h worth of an incredibly diverse and magnificent soundtrack, to both harmonize with the visuals and multiple different conflicts of the individual stories to create the right mood for e.g. melancholic (Adieu playing at the end of episode 8), unsettling (introduction of the Pierrot Le Feu in episode 20) or light-hearted/relaxed moments (the crew chilling on the ship after a done job etc.). As I already said, by the sheer amount of diversity Cowboy Bebop offers through its runtime. The OST has to not only have a solidly high budget and talented musicians to create such a high diversity of tracks in terms of feeling, tonality etc., it also has to keep a distinctive identity through the runtime of the show, if at all possible, rather than a garden variety of different, non-comparable single tracks, that make the not only the OSTs, but also the shows identity to slowly drift into the whatever-territory for me. Bebop managed to keep its distinctive identity though, much, much better than I initially expected before my re-watch, since they managed to keep a prominent focus on Jazz, with little outliers to count, that didnt complement the complete work at all. To pick some of the most talented musicians to be featured in numerous Anime soundtracks, known for her huge talent to cover lots of different genres, Yoko and her crew were almost definitely the best choice, especially for a show that reliant on effective usage of its OST on one hand and very solidly matching singular tracks during action-scenes and what not. 

Incorporating its soundtrack effectively in its storytelling, be it with lyrics, merging with the visuals to effectively use nonverbal communication between the viewer etc. is a task only a few shows in the medium have actively tried, and it's even more of a rarity to find a series which did actually execute this efficiently. However, even then Id be lying, if I said any show deserves the #1 spot other than Bebop. Along with the characters its definitely my favourite aspect about the show, because it knows to effectively pull the trigger in key-moments, during its continues character-conflicts and builds a strong foundation around those moments through several hints in dialogue and even simple postures and gestures being used to tell more about ones feelings in several occasions, furtherly accompanied by the score. The series just does understand people too well, to intersperse that much attention to detail in the mentioned gestures/postures and mimic to show a characters condition is something live-action movies tend to do very well, but Anime regularly struggles with. The most noteworthy moments I remember would be the all so famous church scene in episode #5, when Spike faces the ghost of his past, Vicious, the first time over the course of the story. The played song when Spike approaches his future battleground, Rain, manages to both set in the right tone through instrumentals and manages to tell a story on its own, deeply connected with the main theme of being stuck in the past, as it even gets specified in the lyrics itself. To furtherly raise the stakes of how good the audiovisuals act together in this episode alone, is Spikes falling sequence, where we get to see bits and pieces of already in episode #1 foreshadowed the happenings around Vicious and Spikes bitter dispute and the bloody feud resulting from the growing rivalry in the syndicate. 

Ed leaving the Bebop crew in episode #24 has also been a masterfully executed, melancholic bit of the show, with the crew members downtrodden sadness of another member leaving, while the other one seemingly doesn't come back anymore. Again, this is most importantly conveyed through gesture and music alone, as we see Spike and Jet to superficially process the shock through as simple as to forcefully eat the eggs Jet wanted to cook for the whole crew, as they were revoltingly going down their throats. The interconnectivity between the beginning of episode #12 (Space Lion, Part I) and ending of episode #13 (Part II) usage of the same track, the end of episode #1s villain, Jet chasing the criminal boyfriend of his ex with a swift tune more than an exhilerating track in episode #10 (Ganymede Elegy), the music box at the end of episode #8, the both unsettling tragic conclusion to episode #20 Pierrot Le Fou (furtherly supported by the grotesque imagery in the theme park) and the final two episodes in general are even further display of the OST greatly interacting with Cowboy Bebops narrative in key character and story-moments.


4. The Real Folk Blues (approaching the finale)


As Ive already mentioned several times how the finale is absolutely terrific, however I still have yet to explain why it hit me as hard as it certainly did.

Episode 25 starts off with Vicious attempts to bring down the established leadership finally being shut down, the elders taking appropriate action and arresting Vicious, soon to be killed anyways. Furthermore, Spike and Jet get attacked by pursuers of the syndicate, fatally wounding Jet on one of his legs. Faye, on her own journey, meets Julia on her way, also being persuaded by the syndicates desperate attempts to tie up loose ends. Faye manages to escape with Julia alive, learning this Julia is indeed the line of light Spike so desperately seeks and gets the mission to tell Spike, that shell be waiting there. Back at the ship, Faye arrives just before another attack of gets launched at the crew, with Spike seemingly accepting his upcoming death, but when Spike hears that Faye had met Julia and now delivers a distinctive message to him, it sparks his survival instinct in an instant. 

As there are many aspects to focus on in this episode, my preference might just be how Spike and Jet interact with each other, since this is probably the most telling when talking about the emotional conditions these characters face themselves in having. Firstly, Jets severe injury and probable inability to advance the Bebop through the hardships to come that have already started, raises even more doubts in Spikes mind to finally give into his past chasing him down, mostly implied through posture and overall silence/consternation Spike gives off the definite feeling of having. Jet did both notice Spikes state of mind through his entire journey, as hes unwillingly relentless and is almost acting out of character when his bits and pieces of his backstory come to shine through, and the sudden change for the worse, when Ed left and him and Spike getting attacked in a mundane situation and tries to both give an analogy in what kind of situation Spike is stuck in and he was stuck in before, before he learned how to let go. Jets words do reach spike, but his inability of letting go still goes on, while his will to life was fading away ever so slowly, reaching its maximum when another attack of the syndicate gets launched at them, right after Faye makes her comeback to the crew (Oh well, it was going to happen sooner or later). However, Faye mentioning the possibility of meeting Julia once again, at the said venue that was planned in the past before Vicious interfered, does give Spike hope once again, not only perceptible in mimic, but also the general comeback of his attitude of pushing through, when directly confronted with problems unleashed by his past. The final push Spike needed to get his will back was Jet, furtherly encouraging him when hes seen the spark of life coming back into Spike by the sole mention of his beloved one (Go grasp that thing that you have lost), all meanwhile Vicious manages to take over control of the syndicate by the means of a double-coup, setting up the stage perfectly for (one of) the most memorable finales in anime history. Along with Julias death in episode #26 and the confrontation of Spike and Faye right before the final showdown, adding their individual progress, but greatly differing conclusions both characters have made for themselves, the final episode delivers a conclusion which does not disappoint in any way and reaches a catharsis that feels both personal and incredibly uplifting, considering the events leading up to it. 


5. Conclusion:


Over the course of this review, I mostly did praise Bebop above and beyond heavens and while I still tried to reflect a lot of reoccurring points of criticism based on the fact, that these rather serve as minor criticisms or even nitpicks, because of how incredibly much the show exceeds them in other (and even related) levels. Theres still a somewhat fair point to be made for most of them, since they can greatly influence a shows personal appeal and investment, basically the name of game for Bebop. Although the argument of inconsistent quality can be dismissed by the shows episodic nature, its true that there are similar anime (like Mushishi) in terms of narrative, which are a little more consistent over the course of their runtime, but also never reach the greatness of Bebops best episodes and interconnectivity, making it even more difficult on how to evaluate quality in this precedent matter. 

With all things said and done, I may just come to the general conclusion, that Cowboy Bebop is an absolute must-watch for fans of episodic-storytelling, westernly-influenced style, incredible character-depth being explored in a more than interestingly unique way and both, one of the rawest emotional experiences and the most excellently cathartic ending in Anime I've seen so far, almost certain that I could change the last four words to "of all time" as well. Perfectly crafted and meaningful in what it set out to do and achieve, Bebop will most certainly never die, as an all-time classic or in my heart.

    This short review reflects my honest opinion about this show, I don't intend to spark a flame war with it and I'm writing simply my sincere thoughts about this series.

Cowboy Bebop is an anime that has been long since praised and is regarded as a cornerstone of Japanese animation, unfortunately, the show didn't struck me as impressive in spite of having watched it more than twice over the years. 

Story: 3

The story is set in the year 2071 and revolves around bounty hunters, specifically Spike Spiegel and his "partner", Jet Black, who make a living by chasing criminals of the solar system, later on, the

          
        crew grows larger thanks to the voluptuous Faye Valentine and the skilled hacker Edward.

The plot doesn't show any sign of plot progress until the fifth episode, where Spike's former friend and nemesis, Vicious is introduced, however, the plot of the various episodes fluctuates between linear bounty hunting and secondary or rather silly episodes that barely bear any significant change to the story, this is exactly what disappointed me the most, in fact, the show could be summed up in three or more episodes, perhaps I'm being hyperbolic here, but twelve episodes could have worked just as well. Frankly, episodes like "Mushroom Samba" bore me to death no matter how many times I rewatched the show, the fact is that Cowboy Bebop is full of these kind of episodes, hence forcing myself to watch it took me several efforts, as it goes without saying that it wasn't easy.

Art: 7
The animation doesn't belong in the trash, but neither is anything stunning from my point of view, although it makes the show enjoyable, there's not much to say about it.

Sound: 8
Music is one of the strongest points of the series, I always appreciate Yoko Kanno's works and the songs she composed for this show are no exception, almost every song in the show is worthy of being called memorable, as you'll probably wish to listen to the soundtrack at least once in your life.

Character: 5
It's unfortunate the characters don't match my taste at all, I guess I just can't relate to any of them or found them utterly generic, I like Spike, he's a cool and skilled guy and everything, but it doesn't get deeper than that, even after his backstory was explained along with Jet Black's and Faye's, it didn't impress me in the slightest, the characters are still cliched to the core from the beginning to the end of the anime, thus I can't help but say that I disliked them.

Enjoyment: 6
I always believed that if might have watched the show back when it came out, I would've enjoyed it much more. In my opinion, Cowboy Bebop has aged and nowadays it can't be regarded as a masterpiece as back then. 
I prefer shows like Darker than Black or Dimension W over it, while the two aren't as praised as much as Bebop, they don't feel nearly as generic as it. I enjoyed the ending which took a very unique turn for the better, but all I can say about Cowboy Bebop is that it's an okay show, and doesn't deserve the praise it gets.

Overall: 5
From my previous experiences, I have a hunch that I'm going to anger the fandom. be labelled as a troll or a person with considerably "shit taste" one way or the other, but it doesn't influence my thoughts about the show. I didn't enjoy Cowboy Bebop, but I could have enjoyed it if I watched it in the age it came out. This brief review only describes my subjective opinion and is in no way meant to offend somebody.

    I rated this anime by how I watched several anime in the past 2 years. In celebration I am writing this review to start my reviews.
WARNING: Some spoilers ahead.

First of all this Cowboy Bebop is like several anime in the past like Pokemon and Voltes V which makes the debut of the new character or new plot elements to introduce in every episode.
Cowoby Bebop does the same but makes something different out of it. You can call it Sessions.

In this sessions the viewers will watch how several aspects of life, or futuristic aspects implemented in the show. 

In terms of story I enjoyed several nostalgia

          
        effects of the books that you may have read or heard about the wild west. Both the art, sound, character resonates with the story as no single narrator is to explain what is happening or what is going to happen to our characters.

This makes Cowboy Bebop a classic with just PURE animation which nobody will not expect what will happen and makes you join the ride in which delves into the deeper themes of the show such as loneliness, future corruption of the environment, and space travelling.

You JUST WATCH and SEE what happens in this show. That's the perfect way to enjoy it. You may need to go back and see it again if you need.

Cowboy Bebop has been praised by fans and critics as the greatest anime of all-time, it set a benchmark in the 90s for animation quality, has some of the best storytelling ever written and is one of the most influential anime ever. 

The show is episodic by nature but has enough backstory in each character to give an over arching view. Focusing in on the Bebop crew and their not so successful bounty hunting adventures Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed make up four of the greatest anime characters ever. They each bring something amazing to the show. Ed the super hacker adds a light hearted

          
        element to the show that never seems to slow down or hurt the show in any way like so many other comic relief characters do, Jet the ex cop turned bounty hunter is kind of the father figure in the group, Faye the lovable gambling addict from the past who acts as a counter part to Spike and Spike... oh Spike, probably the coolest anime character ever, how do you not love this guy? he fights like Bruce Lee, has an amazing shot, has a dope backstory, is a total badass and has said some of the most icon quotes in anime history.

The animation is some of the best I've ever seen, backgrounds are detailed, the characters designs are all very unique, the fights flow like water and oh ya this is all hand drawn animation! no cheep tricks or cutting corners every frame of this show is absolutely flawless. The soundtrack on it's own is nice but coupled with the show is like the best anime soundtrack ever.it reminds me of Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece Taxi Driver in how the music seems to fuse so well with the visuals to give the viewer a one of a kind experience. 

Overall Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows ever (anime or not), it has aged like scotch and is a must see for any and every anime fan. Until next time, see you space cowboy

    I gonna be honest with you and I watched all the episodes and it was so unengaging. It must have been one of the best anime of its time but it totally failed to impress me. 

All of the characters (except Jet and Faye) are dull and lifeless especially the stereotypical bounty hunter and gangster spike spiegel. He is a wasted character who tries to be compared to Bruce Lee and Lupin the third and Steve Blum's voice acting makes him sound like a creepy pedophile. 

Enough the animation and music pull's me in it still make's itself a overrated example of corny neo noir

          
        and western shows that go really bad over time. Even though I like to respect your opinions, this critic is going full swing on how truly awful this anime is. 

So in my final verdict I give it a 0 out of 5 for being less than mediocre and more tightened up with a hell load cat shit. For all those professional critics and strong fans who it's perfect we'll it's not and nothing is not my own and and not your opinions too. They call it the greatest anime well I call it when you just get of the toilet after having a horrible stomach ache.

    Cowboy Bebop is a triumph of budget; a paper-thin anime with dynamic, fluid animation, a lovingly crafted eclectic soundtrack, and stylistic nuances for miles (one episode even effectively parodies blaxploitation). I don't mean that in an entirely derogatory way; it's really no surprise this is one of the major things that got people into Japanese animation, because it's an extremely fully realized show, so fully realized in fact that it's easy to overlook broad, undeveloped characters and a fanservice-vehicle female character who's dressed like a space hooker most of the time. There's not much to it, and yet there is.

    If anyone ever asks what my favorite anime is I'll reply, "Cowboy Bebop" without a pause. Its the perfect blend of western and scifi with a hint of noir and any other genre they could manage to fit in there, all supported by some great music. 

Cowboy Bebop has great characters, rich stories, beautiful art, and some of the best music I've ever seen in an anime. The main plot is limited to a small portion of the 26 episodes leaving the other episodes to be largely self contained stories.In this way it is similar to other shows like Gintama that are structured primarily episodaly.

          
        This allows the creators to experiment on every episode with a variety of genres and themes while exploring and developing characters and giving you glimpses of a beautiful and clearly very vast world. 

The episodal nature of the anime while being one of its greatest strengths is also its greatest weakness and a small number of episodes are definite misses especially when it comes to the quality of the rest of the anime. However, as these are all stand alone episodes these shortfalls don't detract from the rest of the anime and if you wanted to could easily be skipped.

    There is not much that can be said about Cowboy Bebop that has not already been said. It is considered a classic among classics, and one of the best anime ever created. It's story, art, soundtrack, and characters are truly beloved by many. I have yet to find a person who does not agree with them.

Story:
Cowboy Bebop does not have an inherent, flowing story like many other anime. It is mostly episodic, yet still manages to be story (and character, but we'll get to that later) driven. The story revolves around a group of bounty hunters in a dystopian future, searching for bounties to make

          
        a living. I will admit that you may become disengaged toward the middle of the series, but it quickly recovers with several exceptional episodes later on. The premise seems uneventful, and when you think about it, not much really happens in the way of story progression. And yet, the plot-lines are captivating, well created and ultimately satisfying. For this, I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for story.

Art:
The art is, to be very honest, nothing unique. It has the same 90's anime look that you've seen, but that is not to say it isn't beautiful in it's own right. The design is solid, with nothing looking out of place. While the art style is not original, it has the best execution of that style I've seen. The animation is consistently fluid and impressive, especially during the fighting scenes, in which Spike's movements look amazing. The show just looks good. I give Cowboy Bebop an 8 for art.

Sound:
The soundtrack of Cowboy Bebop is often hailed as one of the best, with jazzy tunes mixed in with slow classical compositions. If there is one thing you cannot deny, it is that it's soundtrack is refreshingly varied. However, at points I found that the style of music failed to accentuate the moment at hand. While I found this distracting, the overall song choice is exceptional. As nobody can deny, Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack is among the best in not only any anime, but many shows in general. They would agree that the soundtrack deserves a 9.

Character:
If there is one thing exceptional about Cowboy Bebop, it is it's three dimensional characters. I am conflicted, even, to call them characters, because they are just so real. Their drives, their conflicts and their pasts are executed seamlessly and exceptionally. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are not a means to an end, they are not plot mechanics, they are an insight into actual personalities and how they would react in the dystopian future of the world of Cowboy Bebop. I can imagine, in some parallel dimensional, that these people could exist. They are not caricatures, they are convincingly real characters that give Cowboy Bebop a 9 in the character department.

Enjoyment:
If there is anything Cowboy Bebop does right, it is that it makes you feel invested and immersed in the world. The culmination of all the previous aspects is a show that is quite simply fun to watch. In the enjoyment department, that is a great thing. I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 for enjoyment.

Overall:
Cowboy Bebop is a classic, there is no denying. The noir genre has had many great contributions, and I believe Cowboy Bebop is of the best of those. I would have given it a 10 had it not been for some minor hiccups. I don't really think anything deserves a ten that I've personally encountered. But I degress, as this is definitely one of the most influential and impressive anime ever created.

I give Cowboy Bebop a 9 out of 10!

    My First Review ever so bare with me

Well I'm not even going to sugarcoat the fact that Cowboy Bebop was a big letdown for me. I was expecting so much from this series due to everyone hyping it up. But, I was left with underdeveloped characters, beyond idiotic actions from characters, and no one listening to Jet.... EVER. Despite all of this, there were some redeeming factors to this animes such as the music, funny scenarios, and just overall enjoyment.

Story:7
This shows all about the realtionship of a crew consisting of Spike, Ed, Jet, Faye, and little ole' Ein. Just a couple of "bounty hunters" (and

          
        a dog) going from bounty to bounty, and how their pasts sort of catches up with them. Nothing special here really, It's whatever.

Art:8
I'm going to say this first off, I'm not the best judge when it comes to things such as art and animation but there were no problems with either of those in this anime. Pretty solid overall in my opinion.

Sound:10
This would be the entire anime's strongpoint in my opinion. The names of the episodes would be based off of genres, songs, and albums (ex: Asteroid Blues & Ballad of the Fallen Angels) and the music in each episodes sorta correlates to name of the episodes. The soundtrack mainly consists of Jazz and Blues music. These songs/insturmentals always added to the scenes and made them better than they actually were. A fight scene was turned into an AMAZING scene and a sad scene turned into a HEART-WRENCHINGLY SAD SCENE. The music was what made me keep watching this anime.

Character:6
Now his was the weak point of the anime for me. There were so many times where I wanted to know more about the characters like Ed or Ein, or Jet. There was literally no info given about Ed and Ein, they got no love. They were there to lighten up the series yet I know nothing about them. Jet was like the overprotective father of the group and I like that, but NO ONE AND I MEAN NO ONE EVER LISTENED TO HIM. Dang it as so annoying, like there would be CLEAR danger in their way and Jet would give some sound advice but all Faye and Spike wanted to do was die with a bang like HOLY. And Spike was EXTREMELY irrational and idiotic  to the point where it was eye aching. The reason for his innjuries 100% of the time was because he just went on his stupidity, no not instict, but stupidity. His character was cool at first but after a while he reminded me of a rebelious teenager who's overdramatic. Faye was alright, her back story was kinda sad but they explained so quickly I had to deep connection with her. Then there's Jet, not much too say really. He gets one episode of backstory for himself and done. We do get a LITTLE and when I say little i mean minuscule insight from other episodes about his past life, but again that's it.

Enjoyment:8 
Now even though the characters pissed me off, they did have their badass moments. Especially with his knack to use the environment to his advantage and his smooth fighting style. The funny moments with Ein and Ed were also a nice addition. Again, those moments really lightened up the show when it was getting depressing and dark. Also the conversations between people were also pretty hilarious to say the least

Overall: 7.5
Although I did get irritated at A LOT of moments in Cowboy Bebop it was still fairly enjoyable. The music also stepped the anime up a notch on my scale because of how good it was at enhancing the scene rather than take you away from it or kill it entirely. There no problems with art and animation either. In my opinion, this show doesn't live up to the hype in the slightest, It was underwhelming throughout the entire series in my opinion. Although, that ending was pretty sad. If you want to go watch this classic, go ahead, just don't go in with high expectations. REMEMBER NO OF THIS IS FACT, IT'S ALL MY OPINION.

P.S. I may have been a little nit picky with this anime but it was because I actually wanted to look at all aspects of the anime while watching it instead of just blindly watching it and giving it a 10 without knowing exactly what I enjoyed/disliked.

    I first watched Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's door a couple years back and felt genuinely engaged throughout the movie and regretted that it had to end. I had absolutely no idea there was a fantastic piece of artwork in the form of an anime series behind this titular film. Ironically, as I watched Cowboy Bebop I found myself humbly involved with the series to the point that I would pause between episodes to really soak in this fantastic show. It is a genre in itself and never insists that it is. It is a fantastic chronicle of people experiencing an extraordinary lifestyle, but also

          
        dealing with the normal challenges life brings. This series was dedicated to those special moments in your life when you say to yourself in the back of your mind "this is worth it, this is me embracing the moment". Of course these feelings are fleeting, which only makes them more cherishable, much like the brief run of this spectacular series.

The series takes place in the future. Earth has been plagued by freak technological accident and much of the population has expanded to the various planets in the solar system. Each planet is like a whole other world, which are slightly expanded upon during each adventure for the crew of the bebop. The bebop first has only Jet and Spike, bounty hunters looking for work only so they can fill their stomachs. Jet comes from a policing background, which has given him a reputation as the "black dog" who never releases his bite on a case. This gives him a sense of authority and father like actualities throughout the series. His partner, and the main character, Spike, comes from a mysterious past with ties to a crime syndicate known as the Red Dragon. He has since pulled out of the syndicate after realizing that it didn't make him "alive". He plans to be with his true love Julia, but circumstances arise between him and his long time rival Vicious, the only recurring antagonist of the series. As such, Jet and Spike get along well with one another since they are both trying to look ahead instead of behind. As they continue their journeys they meet various people during missions who seem to encapsulate various life experiences in their characters. Love, anguish, betrayal, obsession, loneliness, if only to name a few. Its as if the bounty is only the outer coating to much more involved lessons which are shown through the most subtle of gestures, much like in the real world, where it is hard to really know if something has impacted you until its over Jet and Spike soon meet Faye and Ed, two girls with mysterious pasts. Faye gradually learns of her past albeit at the end of the series at which point she lets down her guard to realize her true home is on the bebop. Ed presents herself as a zainy hacking genius, but she also has ties with her estranged father, which has caused her to wander frequently. WIth the ship's local canine Ein, Ed often makes ideas more clear to viewers through her childlike comedy by shouting them out is crazy ways. All four of these crew members embark on a series of encounters with various bounties. The story is moving on all levels, and remained the least bit contrived throughout, The great thing was the combination of most genres. There was not set plot or motif, which made all of the action and humor more engaging. The viewer is made to care about each exploit because they don't know what to expect on a structural level, but are still able to take tide and true knowledge with them after each stint.

The animation for the series was clearly defined and realistic, with each character being drawn in a way to reveal their personalities on a physical level. Jet is older, more experienced, with receding hair and armor to match. Spike is spontaneous and subtle at the same time, with wild hair and an ironically neat suit to match it. Faye is sexually involving but tough as nails. She is stubborn and selfish, enhanced by her look at me wardrobe. Ed's clothing is enhanced by her unpredictability. You don't really know what to think of her clothing since their it is so basic and childlike. This simplicity allows Ed to be more Astonishing. This pattern of art is seen throughout the character spectrum. All of the worlds are their own and match their tones. Just awesome.

The music for the series was absolutely insane. Each episode is known as a session and essentially the series is rooted from music itself. Every encounter has a soundtrack that enhances the feelings being portrayed in the episode. If its metal, its probably a tense situation, if its jazz, past regrets are being felt, if its classical, love is expressed. This coupled with the beautiful art only makes the story more impacting on a whole other level!??! The whole spectrum of this anime is seen with these combinations of sound and art! Also, each episode title refers to the type of music played throughout.

The characters in this series are the enjoyment factor. The crew of the bebop is so subtle with their affections that it seems like they've been a family for years. At times they don't even care about what the other is doing because it seems vindictive but the subtext is that they do care...so much so that they don't because they know thats just who the other person is. Its a whole other realm of trust that is so true in real life. Like I said earlier, if you couple the family crew of the bebop with influential characters on different worlds with their own messages, it makes it seem like the family learns something together, which makes the viewer learn something from four different angles. All of their actin and humor towards their bounty targets and eachother is hilarious and touching, and just pure entertainment.

I will never regret the time I spent watching, learning, and ultimately living from Cowboy Bebop.

    This was an amazing watch. I can't believe I held out this long to watch it considering how popular this series is.

Story: 9/10

Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime for the most part. While the premise is nothing complicated, the way every episode is delivered is distinct to each other but retains the factors that make this one unique to other series. Repetitions and cliche are rarely seen in Cowboy Bebop, which is very seldom nowadays in anime. The best thing about the story the storytelling is the way the episodic plot is tied with the main story, which is told sparingly but beautifully. It's rare

          
        to find an anime with an appealing plot and even rarer to find something with great delivery.

Art: 8/10

The art and animation are nothing spectacular compared to today's anime but was definitely better than most that came out in the late 90's. One important thing with Cowboy Bebop is the consistency of the animation. I barely saw any drop off in animation and art quality throughout 26 episodes. It's nice considering a lot of anime in the 90's or earlier weren't as consistent with their visuals. 

Sound: 10/10

Tank! by The Seatbelts is one of the most iconic anime openings of all time. Cowboy Bebop definitely one of the best anime of all time in terms of sound and music. The soundtrack is simply amazing, it's something many will enjoy. The special thing about the music is the variety and genre and how it's used in every episode. It really sets the tone and feel of each scene, which is done extremely well. Each piece nicely suits its purpose.

Characters: 10/10

Cowboy Bebop has an excellent set of characters ranging from the main ones and minor ones. It's the component that makes this series come alive and separate it from other anime. The main characters especially are well done. They're diverse, fascinating, have depth and most important of all, they gel really well together. You don't find a set of main characters like that very easily.  

Enjoyment: 10/10

It's been a while since I found an anime that I personally think deserves a 10/10. Many reasons can be given as to why I think this series was such an amazing series for me. You have the story, the music, the characters and just the feel and vibe of the anime. Only a handful of anime has given me this feeling of bliss as I have witnessed something astonishing and dreariness because it's finished. This one's really something else, enjoyment is without question a 10/10

Final verdict:

A lot of people claim it to be one of the best series not just of the 90's but of all time. I personally think that it is one of the best things that has ever happened to the anime industry. It's simply spectacular.

    All things considered, theres nothing quite like it when you come off an anime and realize how much it has built itself as this important piece of art that has since transcended its ever-present influence on other mediums. This particular show, named Cowboy Bebop, definitely lived up the legacy it deserves of being the pinnacle of late 90s anime that would influence a wide variety of anime leading up to the new millennium. Even with all that has been all said and done, thats not to say that Cowboy Bebop has its fair share of hiccups.

But before I get into that, it is important to

          
        distinguish the inevitable nature that director Shinichir Watanabe constructed from the ground up to make Cowboy Bebops world vibrant and distinct. Since Cowboy Bebop has separate plot arcs within each individual episode, with some continuity within its main cast, the show has a great sense of exploratory mystery behind every story being told. You have the sense of wanting to know of these actual people and locations because of how incredibly different they all are. They each have their own distinct look and atmosphere to them. As Watanabe is vastly known for, he loves to mix different types of genres into one show to make them feel unique in his eyes. Normally this could cause a show to lose some main focus as to what it wants to be, but Cowboy Bebop, thanks to its plot structure, paces these genres evenly to make us know the true identity of what it wants to be. Which is essentially a Space Western mixed with Neo-Noir elements in its tone; hence the shows name.

Along with mixing these genres, the sense of direction that encapsulates Cowboy Bebop as a whole transcends itself to a whole new level of creativity. The noir aspect to the show adds a lot more depth to its atmosphere from its attention-grabbing shootout scenes to the silent moments that hook you instantaneously. There are some comedy elements to be seen in Cowboy Bebop and they time it very well and give all the characters great charm to provide solid entertaining moments. They dont just contain bodily comedy by any stretch, but instead, the writing is very sharp and witty whether youre watching it dubbed or subbed.

Memorable characters are in no shortage in Cowboy Bebop, at least within its main cast. Spike Spiegel, Faye Valentine, Jet Black, and Edward are the quintessential quartet to be studied if you are wanting to replicate a great cast such as this. They are not just good because of their excellent character growth, but the amazing chemistry they all have whenever any of them are on-screen together. At first they all act very indecent to each other. It isnt until over the course of several episodes when they truly try to care for one another, yet they still feel the slight edge to go on their own for better or for worse.

Spike is often regarded as the best character and they arent entirely wrong in saying so. He has an alluring presence where he isnt just some strong individual who can handle himself in any given situation or this normal everyday person. He is simply both in some aspects. He has the wit and personality to be both of these types of personalities and you want to root for him because of his likable persona. Of course, it would be a crime to not mention the Dubbed performance by famed voice actor Stephen Blum who manages to make Spike have a lot of suave with his extraordinary voice. And for that matter, almost all of the English dubbed voice actors manage to make Cowboy Bebop one of the few instances where the dubbing is just as good, if not better, than the original Japanese voice acting.

Faye Valentine provides some of the funniest, sarcastic humor to Cowboy Bebop. You could easily chalk her character archetype as a way to push a female character in a largely male present cast to let the males have their way with her body. However, they manage to make Faye into a girl who doesnt take any kind of crap from anyone and has full-control over anything that she finds wrong in her own mind. Then we have Edward, who is by far the most eccentric character of the show by the fact that shes in her own little world where nothing seems to make her overly pessimistic no matter how grave a situation might be. What makes her fascinating to watch is her growth as a person, while at the same time viewing her child-like charm in the same way we would have viewed Edwards way of thinking as a child. Every time shes on-screen, there is a good chance anything is possible in terms of comedic dialogue being thrown out,  and they are all fantastic to listen to. Lastly is Jet Black, whos the most logically, down-to-earth character in the show, other than maybe Spike in most cases. While he may be the lesser of the three other leads, there is no doubt to be made that Jet has his fair share of memorable moments that grows him into a true three-dimensional character like the rest.

Now with this being said about our four main heroes, the rest of the side characters that crop up in these plot arcs are not anything spectacular or memorable in the slightest. Even the main villain of the show doesnt really leave much of an impression in being a noteworthy villain as originally anticipated. This could be forgiven slightly, considering they have only one episode to build them up, but that is not to say all of them are not noteworthy with the Dr. Lobbes character being the best of the bunch. Considering that he was in one of the best episodes that wasnt the last three episodes that succeeded it.

Around the time when Cowboy Bebop first aired, anime recently had begun somewhat of a transitional period where it started to incorporate very challenging, philosophical themes into its narrative. The other two that come to mind are Neon Genesis Evangelion and Serial Experiments Lain. Thats not to say anime did not have anything like this before, but Cowboy Bebop and the rest of the shows I mentioned really pushed it of the stream-of-consciousness into the anime community. With that said, Cowboy Bebop seems to be the one that is the most subtle way of detailing its philosophical themes involving existential concepts. This is both a service and disservice to the shows credit.

The reason being is that although it is very admirable for Bebop to showcase its themes in a non-preachy scenario or be muddled into strange concepts that contradict each other, it subtly limits it from doing anything with most of the narrative plot arcs. You can basically watch Cowboy Bebop and have all of them fly over your head and you would still have the same experience, but once you do notice them, theres not a lot of meat to them for our brains to digest or comprehend. Obviously the finale of the show has a great implication of putting them all together but in the long run, they dont really add up to anything, other than trying to throw out whatever philosophical theme that might seem the most probable in these given situations.

While that aspect wasnt necessarily one of the shows best highlights, the actual plot that carries the main narrative is relatively serviceable and brings up one of the most poignant finales that Ive ever seen in anime. When you feel the growth that all of these characters go through, you never want these characters to go away from one another because of how amazing they play off one another. In fact, once I saw them go their separate ways for a moment, without spoiling any of the important details, I almost felt upset that they even had the inclination of wanting to do so in the first place. Because of the amount of care given to make the personalities of these characters genuine and delightful, the melancholic nature near the finale feels very sincere. If that is writing that could not be considered great by that fact alone, I dont know what is.

Ive always held the belief that Yoko Kanno is one of the best composers to be working in anime to this day, and Cowboy Bebop reigns as the best coordinated orchestration that shes ever done. The opening itself garners some needed praise not only for its recognizable melodies and instrumentation but how it captures the feel and tone of Cowboy Bebop as a whole. What really fits Yokos style of instrumentation and Watanabes creative vision is how they both have the same way of mixing different styles of music and genres that make them feel very on-point to the direction of the art-style and the score that goes with it. Yokos amazing blend of jazz, normal orchestration, guitar rock, and occasional electronics are what create the ultimate soundtrack that would be worthy of being listened to without the need for the shows visuals to accompany it.

Does Cowboy Bebop deserve the amount of perfect accolades that it has been given for the past decade or so? In most aspects, it certainly does. There is simply nothing out there that is quite like it in terms of authentic style and flair that is on-screen at any given point in time. It manages to perfectly pace the witty humor from the deep drama that engulfs each character and the confrontations they have to face, one way or the other. If anything, the characters are enough to warrant a watch from their amazing chemistry and the plot can be well-serviceable for anyone willing to experience it. Its a show that literally goes off with a bang and soars ever so gently off into the blissful reaches of the heavens. In great character stories such as this, this space cowboy is one that can prove himself worthy of being called such a title.

    When I read that Cowboy Bebop is an example of "style over substance" show, I am pretty confused. I enjoyed the show mainly for the depth of their characters, which seemed to me to be very adult and mature in an anime universe full of one-dimensional teenagers. Still Cowboy Bebop doesn't take itself too seriously and plays around with the unsolved problems, paranoias and insecurities of adult live a lot. The histories of the main characters are all well depicted and leave signs in their contemporary lives that can't be completely ignored. The past traumas and life long struggles are shown in detail and evoke

          
        a great focus on human's complexity.

The atmosphere, the tone, the mood of Cowboy Bebop is incredible. Taking elements from exploration sci-fi, western, and noir it creates a stunningly dark and slightly melancholic show perfectly in sync with the jazz pieces of the soundtrack. I feel a great sense of taste in everything while watching Cowboy Bebop. This while still having a great sense of humor which makes the show so enjoyable and not only focus on heavy psychological themes. I think the blending of the different genres and elements of western and japanese culture is perfectly balanced, thus creating something new which hasn't been seen before. The show was promoted by the producers by the motto "a new genre unto itself". It is naturally an exaggeration, but it does contain an element of truth. Instead of focusing totally on japanese drawn elements this show goes far beyond and creates an opera magnum which even Film as a medium has difficulties to achieve, being restricted in rules of the genres. Few directors have been able to transcend these limits and I believe Cowboy Bebop is considered a classic also for its ability to mix different elements coherently and beautifully. 

But honestly I believe this is not enough to create a masterpiece. The CULT of this show is delivered by interesting combination of before contradictory or too-different elements while thematizing universal problems such as existentialism, loneliness, ethics. Friendship and relationship to other people is depicted in such great detail you surely will find something to see yourself into. 

Long story short, Cowboy Bebop is not only style over substance. Thematic elements are incredibly deep and mature thus making it an unique experience. A classic.

    My favorite anime of all time.Classic.

Story-Ups and downs of ragtag bounty hunter crew made of ex-cop,ex-crime syndicate member,femme fatal,reverse underage trap and  genetically modified corgy .BeBop crew travels trough space in search of good bounty and usually bounty money is spent on paying for buildings,cars and other things they destroy during there hunt.

Art-I really don*t care that much about art,I mean I watched all episodes of One Piece 

Sound-Best soundtrack ever.The Seatbelts(band) is awesome they blew my mind.Mixture of smooth jazz,  bebop, and classical Mississippi Delta blues.Orgasmic

Characters-Hard to write with out spoiling but I can say that there development is very good.Also all

          
        crew members have some type of quirk  especially that reverse trap character

Enjoyment-When I started to watch I was bit skeptic about this anime but oh boy did I enjoyed the ride.I recommend this anime to every anime fan.

Overall-Combination of badass characters,epic story and orgasmic jazz/blues soundtrack makes this anime,in my humble opinion, one of best anime that is ever made.I will fight you if you say that this anime,this opus magnum of 
Japanese animation is bad.

    If you aren't really emotionally invested into the characters early on, there is no overarching narrative to hold onto, so the only things that kept me personally watching were the beautiful and painstakingly detailed visual environments and character designs, and the outstanding soundtrack.

And yes, I can appreciate, some of the thematic undertones, relating to personal demons explored in the later episodes of the show, if you don't fall for the characters emotionally, something I imagine is extremely subjective, it may be a little harder to watch, that is less addictive, than other shows with a little more in the way of consistent narrative progression.

    "Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all comers to play, night after night, at a club named "Minston's Play House" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other. Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of risky things. They must create new

          
        dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... COWBOY BEBOP"

That quote is probably a valid review of the first 24 episodes of the anime.

Cowboy Bebop is a set of parables, picking up and dropping off at whatever random points the main characters happen to stumble upon them, and in some cases, ending them. The beauty in Cowboy Bebop stands in the one story that we kinda sorta actually get to see. The story of Spike. I would argue that just about every other story told would be just as interesting as his if only we had the time to more fully develop the characters and plot. But Spike's story, that one we do get the pleasure of experiencing. The weight that we get to carry. 

This anime is about a very specific aspect of the human experience: empathy. It forces us to empathize with a roster of characters and watch them struggle. Not at all to the extent that as something like Texhnolyze, but enough to make you really ponder the reality of what you've just seen. Every character lives and dies by their own decisions, and you're tasked with burdening those decisions; to understand and accept them. 

Other than that, it's simply an astonishingly good looking, good sounding, mostly episodic, perfect anime with tons of style points.

    Cowboy Bebop is set in the future well intergalactic travel is normal and everyone has their own spaceship. Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black are two bounty hunters and owners of the spaceship Bebop. Later joined by Faye Valentine, Ed and Ein, the group fly around in space, taking on bounties to survive. Each bounty they take is more trouble than they are worth but they take them with good hearts and a good sense of humor. You learn more and more about each character as the series rolls on a grow strongly attached to each of them by the end.

The series is very

          
        episodic in a way that each episode has no real relation to each other, except the double part episodes. There isn't really a story to be told aside from the group hunting bounties and Spike dealing with his past. That is the reason it took me so long to watch this series. Although I enjoyed watching the characters and their adventures, I found it rather hard to start the next episode. There wasn't exactly a draw that hooked me into watching it. That, however was my only problem with the series. Aside from that, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.

The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Many episodes explain more about each characters past and makes you grow attached to each other them. I can't say there was a character that I disliked from this series as they were all so different and so interesting to watch. My personal favorite was Faye. I don't want to give anything away, but she has a couple rather interesting episodes that bring tears to my eyes. Each character has somewhat of a sad past, each of them having someone they loved and lost and rediscovering them in different ways. 

I watched it dubbed because I heard that the dub was amazing and many say even better. I thought it was great, no complaints at all. It's not in a setting where Japanese culture matters, I suppose. The music is jazzy and the intro will be stuck in my head for the rest of my life. I don't care too much for art from the 90's but for an anime from 1998, I thought it looked amazing. One thing I do want to point out though, was that everyone in the anime appeared human. I don't know exactly how much of space they explored or how many planets they go to, but everyone was human. It's not a complaint or anything, just pointing that out.

Aside from the patchy story, I thought Cowboy Bebop was an amazing anime. It was really entertaining, the action is violent, the characters are lovable, the humor is rich, pretty much everything you could ask for.

Likes:
-All the characters were fantastic, learning about a characters backstory is something I love and Cowboy Bebop explains each of theirs incredibly well.
-"SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY..." was something I loved seeing at the end of each episode, it's so small and simple yet I absolutely loved it.
-I really wish I could fly around in space and hunt bounties across the stars

Dislikes:
-The ending really bothered me, not exactly the ending really, but what happens leading to the ending. If that makes sense.

Story: 10 
It has a good premise, an uncommon one so it makes it more interesting. The story when it has fun, it really has fun, and when it gets sad, it really gets sad. I was close to shedding a tear towards the end but I was overcame by a feeling of hollowness, which is much worse. I got closure from the end, but I don't think I'm satisfied with it. I'm really gonna miss this one.

Hands down one of the best openings I've ever seen. It's not textbook, it's creative, it presents characters in an unorthodox way,

          
        it transitions in an unorthodox way, it's an opening I wouldn't mind watching through over and over again. Animation is top quality, and the fights are just a joy to watch. Same goes for all of Watanabe's works. As for character design, I absolutely love it, I've never seen such different characters. Every character is distinct from one another, and it makes the anime so much more memorable. Not to mention, the animation. The animation is superb, especially for an anime of its time. The fight scenes are so clear and smooth, so entertaining.

Spike is an interesting one. That being said, all of the characters are interesting. Including the supporting characters that only last an episode or two. They have all have an interesting background and personality that makes them so much more memorable.

I LOVE THIS ANIME. I love Samurai Champloo as well. I've always been a fan of Watanbe's work. He has a story that just hits it on the nail that keeps you wanting for more yet helps you understand that there can't be more. Perhaps if I were to critique anything about the anime, is that it's only so long. It feels like it can go on forever, but at the same time I feel as if 26 episodes is enough. Nevertheless, it's an anime I can say blows out any anime of its genre out of the water, including the newest ones.

Overall: 10
ABSOLUTE must watch. I don't care if you don't watch action anime. Cowboy Bebop is an ABSOLUTE must watch. It's undeniably good, and a definite classic.

    Cowboy Beboop (ha) is an episodic anime with a dog. That is not a bad thing but that is essentially what is. The story is set in the future where the earth was partially destroyed and most humans live in space. It follows Spike and Jet, two cowboys (space bounty hunters) and their adventures in space.

This is an easy set-up for an episodic show to use because much like space the possibilities of an episodic show are infinite. It adds a few more mainstay characters that we learn about and that are interesting (including a dog!). The crew of the Bebop (Jet and Spike's ship)

          
        are nicely miss-matched group, even Spike and Jet, but it's this clash of personalities and characters make them all the more enjoyable as a group and as individuals.

In saying this the voice actors do a good portrail of their individual character (I watched the dub). They're many moments in the show that gave you the 'feels' as it were, so one couldn't really argue that the VA's weren't in it, at least as my memory of the show serves. Furthermore the score was well done and makes every scene better than they usually are and is one that'll definitely stick if your a jazz or slow jam person. In addition the OP is one I still enjoy to this day and really works well both as an OP and a stand alone song, the ED thought not as good makes each episode feel complete.

The art style looks worn, though that is only due to Bebop's age and either be a plus or a minus depending on the taste of the person. Everything in the world of cowboy bebop feels and looks real to a degree and the movements are descent. The stiller moments seem to shine for me more than the more action packed scenes but that's not to say they weren't good I just like the quieter moments in cowboy bebop more.

Lastly I'd like to say that I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop as both an idea and a show. I don't enjoy a lot of episodic shows because they get repetitive (Simpsons, Spongebob, Fairly Odd Parents) but Cowboy Bebop shuffles the focus every episode to offer a little something  for everyone. No episodes fealt the same or dealt with the same character or plot, which is to be expected of an episodic show and as such a lot of the plot comes at the end.

In conclusion if your looking for old, fun, gritty, and episodic anime that feels different every episode then Cowboy bebop is the show your looking for.

    Cowboy Bebop - I believe is one of the most loved animes out there, even today.
There are great reviews here for this anime - reviews that'll make you want to watch or drop it.
So why is another one needed? - Well, some people just like to have insight over things they have an interest for.

Bear in mind that this is a review from someone who completed the Anime in 2017. Maybe it'd have been different if I watched it back in 1998, but I didn't, so I have to judge it from what I felt at the time of watching it. Also, please don't hate

          
        me for not loving Cowboy Bebop - I don't mean to bash it, I'm just sharing my experiences.

I didn't go in expecting a lot from Cowboy Bebop but I just knew I had to watch it because it's such a classic. I think that was a good thing.

Storywise... there's not much going on. It's definitely the weakest point overall. I mean, there's a story to be told - but it's sort of scattered all over the place when it didn''t need to be. It's a simple story told in erratic ways. Simply put, the narrative is flawed. You'll get bits of information here and there, which then will be forgotten for some time for no apparent reason. I'm fine with episodic anime, I actually like them, but Cowboy Bebop did not work for me - the switching between telling you one piece of the story and then moving to a random episode where absolutely nothing important or interesting happens is really off-putting to me. At least they should have used these to advance the plot in better ways instead of just coming up with another "Saturday Morning Villain" (which again, has no connection whatsoever to the rest of the anime - it'd have been fine if it was done once or twice, but more than that really pushed my patience).

In terms of Audio/Visual presentation, the studio did a fantastic job, and I say this even though I did not like most of the soundtracks and style of music used - but I can recognize that they put a lot of effort into it and that it fits the theme they had going on. There seems to be, as many have pointed out, a lot of Western influence here. Even the characters seem to be made in a way that appeals "more than usual" to western audiences.

There's great variety between each character, and I have to applaud the art team because the anime holds up well even nowadays, in fact, I'd say it looks better than most animes out there today precisely because it has it's own very defined and original style.

Sadly, most of these characters weren't explored well - this hurts the show a lot because it makes caring for them harder than it should be.

The thing is though, even though I could write a lot more to complain, Cowboy Bebop still managed to entertain me with its action scenes - which is why I give it a 7 overall. I had way more fun than with Black Lagoon for example (which I found dull and boring). There's just something likeable about Spike and the way he handles his problems which is very... entertaining.

As someone else said in another review, what you'll get here is ''style over substance".

    I thought I'd try writing a review for once, and also for an anime I have sort of complicated feelings on so here goes! 

I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop a lot more than most anime, so it was by no means unenjoyable. However, I never liked it as much as a lot of people and also by comparison to a lot of really popular anime so I'm going to try and pinpoint the reasons for that.. it's still a very entertaining anime though make no mistake!

Basically, it just comes down to not really being a big fan of the characters at times.. Spike is kind of

          
        a bit easygoing for me, Jet is kind of a bit stiff, Ed is kind of too random, Faye is sort of greedy. 

Well ok, Faye is pretty cool, it's true, then Ed..  but overall I the biggest thing was that Cowboy Bebop kind of starts off insanely slow and is very, very cautious 

Now, that is, on the one hand, appealing! Certainly Cowboy Bebop is one of the more engaging anime for that reason, but when things often had a kind of filler-y approach for the most part. 

The story moves around a lot, basically Spike and Jet are perpetually out of $ because they keep almost failing to get so-and-so or such-and-such, as a consequence the anime is more about the banter and character experiences as much as the big mega moments involving old hatreds or new optimism or whatever it is. 

Like, ok, it's a unique blend of different worlds, it's fantastical, it's realistic, it's sensible and boisterious, it's a strong personality, it's Cowboy Bebop, but, the best? Hmm I mean consider there are lots of really engaging anime out there. 

Ok, lets make a deal, and put Cowboy Bebop up there, but the movie much more resonant in many ways, it incoporated the cool things about the anime and kind of squished it into something that didn't feel like it dragged as much. 

Overall, I can't say I hated Cowboy Bebop, it just felt like the experiences of emotional high were few and far and in between, thus, an 8 (ah screw it, I'll just give it a 9)

    Cowboy Bebop is an absolute classic. Most people would say this is 'the pinnacle of all anime shows'. While there are some aspects of the show I liked, to say that this is the BEST of the BEST seems a little far-fetched to me.

Cowboy Bebop is set in the distant future where space travel has been developed. Bounty hunters exist around the solar system to capture criminals and survive by being rewarded for their bounty. The story centres around 4 main characters - Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine and Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV (or Ed) and it tells us of their journeys

          
        and struggles.

I'll get a lot of the repeated praises out of the way first, before people completely disregard the whole review for the issues I had with the show.

The animation is splendid - that, I simply cannot deny. For a 1998 anime, the quality definitely rivals the most up to date ones and still surpasses a vast majority of them. The movements of the characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds are so crisp clean, it is virtually eye candy for any viewer.

Another thing Cowboy Bebop succeeds in is the soundtrack. The opening song 'Tank!' is one of the most iconic tune in anime history and will be immediately recognised by most anime watchers. Although the opening song and background music aren't suited to my tastes (by that I mean I wouldn't listen to them on my MP3 player) it sets the mood perfectly for a lot of the scenes within the show. Another compliment goes to the ending theme song 'The real folk blues' which I frickin love (Now THAT is on my MP3 playlist).

As for the voice acting, both the English and Japanese voice actors/actresses have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. Their performances in their own respective languages has virtually no flaws. So if you ask me which language to watch it in, it would be - it doesn't matter, both are good, it really is up to you.

Now here's where I must be careful of what I say...

So why couldn't I enjoy this as much as the 99% of people who declare that this is the definition of masterpiece? I guess the main reason would be the episodic nature of the show. Of course this is subjective from person to person. I personally would have liked to see the characters have an overall goal where a satisfying conclusion is met rather than individual episodes with their own plots.

But that isn't where the real problem lies. A good show should have a great start which draws the viewer in, a strong central story where character development can take place and finally, it should have a memorable ending. Unfortunately, the first few episodes of Cowboy Bebop aren't that entertaining. It's average at best but nothing spectacular to draw the audience into the show, if anything pretty standard fair to introduce all the characters.

It picks up its pace and starts to get interesting when it reaches the episode 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' (episode 5). I don't want to spoil anything, but this is the first episode where the anime gets more serious. We learn a little about Spike's past and it starts to get more fascinating... BUT here's where I feel Cowboy Bebop fails at. The episode just ends. It side tracks to something else. The next episode is something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels that what I've just seen gets abandoned - tossed to the side. Any tension built up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get really irritated.

I want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely forgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the case. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment. Now this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is average to worth watching at best but nothing spectacular for it to be called a 'masterpiece'.

One more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some which I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed were the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for the other episodes, I feel "meh" towards them.

Finally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to end the show. (yay! another compliment!)

Maybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry' the series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping fascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I feel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good looking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his past, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other main characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a short time span.

Though the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor were they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than others. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.

Let me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly the villain of the show but I can't help but question things like "why is Vicious like this?", "why is he supposedly the villain?", "what are his motivations?" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I mean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely abandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.

All in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters are - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go "maaan that young child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character" I hope at least one or two people can catch the gist of what I'm trying to say.

Now, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I simply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the 'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a classic.

    "Cowboy Bebop" reeks. It really does. It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.

I'm not gonna bother writing about how cool the main protagonist Spike Spiegel is, or how colourful the rest of the cast are - those are established facts and have been discussed to death already, so I'm gonna write about what makes "Cowboy Bebop" different instead. Almost everything about it is unusual. It's a clash of a huge number of often contradicting styles that, on paper, looks like disasters waiting to happen. However, the reality is that "Cowboy Bebop" takes everything in its stride

          
        and pulls off the stunt with flying colours. It catches the attention straight away with its strikingly retro opening sequence reminiscent of a typical jazzy 70/80's TV series. The feel of the anime itself is a seamless marriage of anime sci-fi and American westerns, backed up by some slick jazz/blues (as well as other African-American influenced) sound track. Even discounting these obvious western influences, it's still very un-anime like in a lot of respects - the art style goes for what I would call stylish realism, it's very slightly comically oriented, with no giant eyed cuteness or super distortions in sight. The humour it uses is also mostly toned down, subtle, western humour as opposed to the in your face, over the top slap stick found in most other anime. And yet, at other times, its anime roots shine through brightly - for example the character design of Vicious, with his katana and grey/white hair, is about as anime as you can get (well, maybe he could do with longer hair, like Sephiroth's from Final Fantasy VII).

Even in its content, "Cowboy Bebop" breaks new ground. It doesn't go for a long continuous plot, but instead opts for the episodic format, but with one flagship storyline spanning 5 episodes that pops in during various parts of the series. This doesn't sound special by itself, but what is remarkable is the sheer diversity found in the episodes. It proclaims itself to be a work that "becomes a new genre in itself", which might sound arrogant to the point of delusional. But this bold, swaggering claim actually has a ring of truth to it. "Cowboy Bebop" is like a huge number of genres combined, and yet doesn't fully fit into any particular one simply because it's composed of so many. Like one of those annoying people that you used to know from school who is good at everything, whatever genre "Cowboy Bebop" touches turns to gold. The comedy is hilarious, the action is edge of the seat stuff, and the horror themed episodes do manage to create a kind of unsettling atmosphere of anticipation and suspense. I think almost everyone will find something to their taste. Moreover, since I haven't anything like this done before, and anything that comes after that dares to attempt anything that's even remotely similar will be seen as copying (for example, even though "Samurai Champloo", produced by the same person, is an undoubted success, it had no where near the impact of "Cowboy Bebop"), "Cowboy Bebop" has effectively cemented itself as a unique experience in a class of its own. 

Quite a few of the episodes in "Cowboy Bebop" reveals some of the characters' backgrounds, but they don't reveal everything. For the most part, only subtle hints are given, and you're left to join up the sparsely distributed dots using your own imagination. Usually I hate this kind of thing, but you know what? In the special case of "Cowboy Bebop", it somehow WORKS. In this case, less is more, the show's incomplete state feels just right, and the tantalising bits of clues and short flashbacks piece together into a enigmatic, fragmental past that adds to rather than detract from the flavour of the anime. There is no better example of this than during the flagship storyline where we catch a glimpse of Spike's mysterious past. In fact these episodes deserves special mention - they are clearly meant to be the diamonds amongst the gems. In crafting these episodes, the creators obviously asked themselves the question: the short stories' collective strength lies their variety, so what can we do with this central attraction to make it stand out? The answer was obvious: it was to make it into something that's the very definition of awesomeness. And boy did they achieve it. The general gist of this story is Spike settling scores with Vicious, an old enemy from his little known past. It's a classic set up that's been used many, many times before, and on the face of it, "Cowboy Bebop" doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But saying this segment of "Cowboy Bebop" is just another one of those show down between nemesis stories is like saying J. S. Bach is just another Baroque composer. Bach was not known as an innovator, and distinguished himself as the greatest composer of his time simply by being so much better than everyone else. In the same way, "Cowboy Bebop" took a much used idea and, despite not doing anything that's different, produced something that's on a completely different plane to everything else. Everything about "Cowboy Bebop" is already smooth and polished, but in those episodes the production somehow manages to climb up yet another level, and every single fiber of it is executed to perfection.

That Spike vs Vicious segment of "Cowboy Bebop" is so good in fact, that viewers often mistake it as the only story "Cowboy Bebop" is trying to tell, and thus the other episodes naturally gets mistaken as fillers, and this is one of the most common criticisms levelled at "Cowboy Bebop" - it's composed almost entirely of fillers. But I think this is missing the whole point of the series. Just like a serious show should not be faulted for not being funny, "Cowboy Bebop" should not be faulted for being episodic, but should be judged based on what it's trying to achieve. What it is trying to achieve is variety, and thus purposefully avoided the continuous story format. Those "fillers" are essential building blocks towards achieving this aim, and so shouldn't really be regarded as fillers at all. Real fillers would be like in "Full Moon wo Sagashite", where they actually got a continuous story to tell, but instead of telling it chose to go faffing around on mostly unrelated mini adventures that nearly put me to sleep. The key question is does "Cowboy Bebop" deliver what it's trying to deliver, and there is no doubt in my mind that is does.

It's generally acknowledged that "Cowboy Bebop" is not a deep anime, so the fact that shows up at the top of so many critics' list arguably makes it the biggest triumph for a style over substance anime. The show's ending theme is called "The Real Folk's Blues" (ironically, it's actually a rock song) - rather appropriately, I thought, because this series frequently give rise to some of the most contemplative, melancholy moments despite not being terribly deep. These kind of moments often left me with a feeling of immense fulfilment as the end credits starts to roll. Perhaps it's this engimatic quality that lends it that special aura. It may not be my personal favourite, but unlike, say, "Elfen Lied", I can certainly see why it deserves to be labelled as the greatest ever - I, for one, am not about to argue against it.

    At 2071, Earth is not the only habitable planet in the Solar System. With the advent of hyperspace technology comes new rules, eras, laws, law-breakers and law-enforcers. Aboard the shuttle Bebop, bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black struggle, bounty after bounty, with unruly shipmates, mutated-lobsters and vengeful old-timers from the past, all while keeping the Bebop afloat.

My reasons as to why Cowboy Bebop is a must see:
1. Spike Spiegel
2. The Real Folk Blues soundtrack, and;
3. Session 5: the Ballad of the Fallen Angels

Cowboy Bebop is a straight-forward anime. Spanning 26 episodes called sessions, Cowboy Bebop boasts of great character designs, fluid animation, splendid voice

          
        acting and one hell of a soundtrack.

Cowboy Bebop is synonymous with great music. Each session is entitled with reference to a musical concept or title, and each session is buoyed by the ever present tunes and strains of jazz and blues, composed by the great Yoko Kanno.

Animation-wise, the series has outstanding visuals all throughout its entire season. Movement and action are beautifully designed (most especially Spike's fight scenes using jeet kune do) and top-notch. Those who prefer the visuals over the everything else will not be disappointed.

Combine great visuals, with great music, plus great characters and great story, this is one anime every anime lover should watch (See how many greats I used in just one sentence??)

My only qualm with the series, a qualm that's quite insignificant, really, is the way the characters' backstory are never really fully explored. Conclusions and closures are, by turns, done during the first and last half of the season. Though all sessions are still enjoyable and comedic, it would have been nice if sessions devoted to the main characters story arcs were explored.

Still, Cowboy Bebop is one-giant step above other animes, one that should not be missed. Grab/borrow/rip/steal a copy and you've got yourself one big bounty

    Cowboy Bebop is the result of a perfectly mixed drink. On the surface, its a futuristic space western about a ragtag group of bounty hunters during their adventures and misadventures. If you take a closer look, however, you will see sprinkled throughout a perfect mix of genres: dashes of horror, comedy, crime, romance, tragedy, philosophy, action, and parody all combined into one neat package. Each episode is a little different from the others by following the same cast of characters from all facets and angles. With each unique episode comes its own strain of music; from tribal drums and chants to electronic pulses. And yet

          
        each song and episode somehow always fills you with the emotions that come with its namesake: bebop, blues and jazz. Despite airing around 15 years ago, Cowboy Bebop has continued to hold its place as one of the greatest anime shows ever to be created, a fact cemented by its vast array of awards and the legacy that followed in its wake. 
	The brew that is Cowboy Bebop gets is aroma and flavor from its cast of characters. At first glance, they are a strange group of characters that are only in bounty hunting for the quick cash so they can eat. As the series progresses, the characters are slowly revealed and their intentions known. You first think Spike to be a slacker who does the bare minimum on the job, only to learn later of his past in the criminal underground and the loss that killed him emotionally. Jet is the gruff authority figure until you realize he cares deeply for the crew as family. Faye is your typical wild and free female lead but only because her deep set tragic background has forced her to push away any sort of relationship. Ed is an amazing hacker prodigy who has no rhyme or reason until you learn of her past and deprived childhood. The diverse casting, build up, and execution provides a strong set of personalities that the viewer is easily able to get behind and root for.
	This blend of a show solidifies itself a diverse soundtrack and fluid animation, even by todays standards. Each of the 26 episodes have a certain spunk to them, whether they be comedy or tragedy. Some argue that one seasons worth is hardly enough to really flesh out what this series could have been. While this may be true, this series does a splendid job of mixing itself into one strong, dynamic, and satisfying experience that caps itself off just at the peak of its ability.

    Cowboy Bebop sets the bar. I take that back; it's nonsense to set the best as a standard. Not only does it put many others in its genre to shame, but many Hollywood productions should also cower in fear of this magnificent masterpiece.

Bebop's episodic nature is exemplary of what artists can do with anime. It has story arcs, but it also has independent episodes like the throwback to Alien and the terrifying one about Pierrot Le Fou. This flexibility allowed its artists to explore a wide variety of themes while maintaining consistency. The storycraft occasionally walks a fine line between detail and ambiguity at times,

          
        much like film noir of old, but it never feels muddled. From the iconic Swordfish spaceship to the space casinos, the cyberpunk and "used universe" atmosphere is realized by the art, which really brings the believable near-future world to life. 
Furthermore, Watanabe's direction is truly masterful; each episode feels complete and whole, and the series has great pacing as well. Watanabe also provided brilliant direction to action sequences, with fights paying homage to Bruce Lee and breathtaking chase scenes.

Great characters are essential to a character-driven plot, and Cowboy Bebop shines in this regard. The series features amazing characters that build on archetypes with their own twists. Their backstories work in tandem with the archetypes, which makes them all the more memorable and not mere caricatures. Character interactions are relatable and meaningful, always with genuine chemistry. 

The series' music deserves a special section all of its own. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts really made a timeless hit with every single song they wrote for Bebop. The soundtrack prominently features jazz such as the iconic OP "Tank!" but also slow-paced blues and even pop music. It is difficult to write about music, as preferences in thus is such a basic if not primal sensation. The most I can say is that if you like jazz and blues, you will fall in love with the soundtrack immediately; if not, you really might start liking these genres.

This series had the gall to include the line "and the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop" in the OP. The nerve of them to do that...and yet I find myself wholeheartedly agreeing with them. Cowboy Bebop is the ultimate combination of a great storyline, endearing characters, amazing music, and you will never watch anything quite like it. This is undoubtedly a classic, and my favorite anime series of all time.

    Hmm...what to say about Cowboy Bebop. Well, it's definitely a show that has it's ups and downs. Sometimes you'll watch it and be like "this episode sucks" and other ones will have you at the edge of your seat/couch. The antics of the main characters are hilarious but underneath their humerous appearance lay hidden secrets and sad pasts. Like most anime, it has it's action scenes and love scenes. It's worth watching if you can get past a few of the not so exciting episodes. But like I said, there's only a few that the series could do without. In the end howevere, it's worth

          
        watching.

    I think Cowboy Bebop is overrated. OK now fans of the 90's with your torches and pitchforks calm down and let me have my own opinion. personally, while I do see why people love this anime I think they're reading too much into it and worse, some of them overhype it to such a degree that other better anime in my opinion suffer from unjust criticism. Note that if you like it a lot, fine I respect your opinion, I really do, nor do I think less of anyone who does. Just don't call me immature just because I don't like it because, I am

          
        NOT an idiot. OK?

Now why didn't I like it? I can't simply list the stuff I liked and didn't like so I'll review the show as a whole. Everyone says that they like it for the characters, animations, simple plot and the narrative which is supposed to be subtle and leaves a lot to the imagination of the viewer.

Animation is very, very good and the action is some of the greatest (well, most of the time. The 'fight' in episode 19 sucked) and the soundtrack, with or without the way it was used is one of the greatest ever. Favorite tracks include Blue, Call me Call me, The Real Folk Blues, Ask DNA and of course Tank!

Before I talk about the plot, let me talk about the characters. Spike and Faye are without a doubt the most interesting characters in the whole show. Faye herself starts off as a 'femme fatale' character that dislikes men and tries manipulating them for her own wants. We later see what gave her this mind set and her back-story was believable and rather tragic, so much so I actually did feel sorry for her. She does develop a lot through what I deem intense suffering and I like how she gets a crush o Spike. Speaking of Spike, he's also a complex character, one who is fairly sympathetic and compelling. Despite being really lazy and only cares about food and playing pool because he believes life is nothing but a dream, he still searches for and loves his missing girlfriend. OK, so far so good but Spike has a really grating flaw of being very reckless and wild when chasing his bounty. We've seen him engage in dogfights with a lot of his bounty whilst being inside a populated city too many times to count. Because of this, the show states, a lot of the bounty they do get ends up being used to pay for property damage. Oi, writers, what about the hundreds of people Spike accidently massacred? To make this worse, some of the people he is chasing aren't necessarily a threat like Jet's ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend Rint. I mean dude, they were on a cheap boat, stop trying to kill them just because youre hungry. Geez.

Jet while still complex has a really clichd back-story and I didn't care much for his character whilst Ed is Ed; she's funny and can even be cute but thats about it. She doesn't have that much depth as a character. Vicious was an interesting and effective villain though. I actually did want to know more about him and his plans and motivations are actually interesting. The same cannot be said for most of the other villains. Pierrot le Fou as I said was a boring character and his back-story is also really clichd. I mean come on, how many time have we seen a villain who becomes evil because of torture before? How many villains also have an amusement park of doom as their secret hideout? And is it me or did episode 20 of Bebop have much more fluid animation than usual?

Now, you'll tell me that Bebop's main appeal isn't the plot so much as the characters who themselves are supposed to be everyday type of people; you'll tell me that Bebop is more about the experience, that it wanted people to feel rather than give them a normal 3 (or 4) act story. Note I love works of fiction that are supposed to be more of an experience and don't necessarily have a plot and I also love different characters. Sadly, I didn't find the world of Bebop or the premise that interesting. I didn't care for the characters that much, I didn't care for the world and I also didn't experience anything from Bebop's story that other anime have given me. The only time I can say I actually felt anything was in episode 24 with the scene where the song Call me plays. I actually did cry at that scene but thats it. The rest of the series didn't give me anything that would make me feel sad, angry, sick, happy or anything. Yeah, do you remember that scene in episode 26 where a friend of the protagonist dies? Yeah, I didn't cry because I did not care.

They say that Bebop's narrative style relies not only on the music but also on the lack of back-story, letting people draw up their own conclusions. Draw up conclusions to what? What motivates the characters to act like they do? I guess it did work pretty well sometimes but not all of the time and this is another major flaw I found with Bebop. I didn't care for most of characters because I didn't know a lot about them and what I knew were too vague. In a work of fiction you can't build off a character based on mere hints: we must have a reason to care and the only character I really cared for was Faye as her back-story wasn't clichd in the least and she was actually interesting. 

Even Spike who is an interesting character on his own suffered from me not caring because I didn't get his mindset. What made him believe that life is just a dream? What made him give up on life? What DO Spike and Julia see in each other? No, scratch that, somebody tell me what is so interesting about Julia because other than being Spike's girlfriend and one who cares for him a lot, I don't know much about her. I don't know what Spike sees in her, how they got off and developed their relationship and when things start to take a turn for the worse for them, I found myself not caring because as I said, I didn't have a reason to care about this relationship. In other good anime and manga like Berserk, Rurouni Kenshin, Sankarea, Clannad etc... we actually see the main couple develop feelings for each other over time, so much so that when they do suffer it becomes all the more heartbreaking. Bebop, didn't show Spike and Julia developing. They just got it off (I guess) and pretended to leave their relationship to our imagination. Explain anime, explain!

With this thought process, am I to assume that Ed became the way she is because she had to roam the world because her father abandoned her? There are plenty of children who are homeless and yet aren't insane so what on earth drove Edward to become like that? Something more sinister maybe...

I also disagree with the line ''And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop.'' I find it pretentious and non-sensical because no matter how many genres it crammed into its 26 episodes, it didn't explore every genres strengths and devices and in the end it is and will always be a science fiction action show.

The absolute worst flaw Bebop has though is the lack of plot and character development and over reliance on filler episodes. The best episodes like Jupiter Jazz, The Real Folk Blues, Hard Luck Woman and of course, Ballad of Fallen angels all had character development or a new revelation about the most interesting characters namely, Spike and Faye. Most of the time though, the show was spent on the 'gang' either tracking a boring clichd villain (like Pierrot le Fou and the Space eco-terrorists), not very funny comedy antics (Mushroom Samba, Cowboy Funk and Toys in the Attic) and sometimes, I found myself absolutely bored by the show with really pointless episodes (like Speak like a Child and the horrible Wild Horses).

Now, I'm someone whom likes good episodes that don't necessarily advance the plot but instead reveal more about the characters and the world they live in. Cry for the devil was very good and so was My Funny Valentine. Ganymede Elegy was a good episode showing more of Jets back-story and Gateway Shuffle was rather intense and atmospheric. Most of the other episodes weren't like that. My least favorite Bebop episode is Wild Horses: there wasn't an interesting fight scene, the characters introduced were very forgettable and we didn't find out more about the world of Bebop because the episode TOOK PLACE IN A FREAKING DESERT FULL OF UNINTERESTING SAND! The episode before it was just as bad because half of it is just Jet and Spike searching in vain for a VCR in order to play the mysterious video tape Faye received. Some people thought the entire struggle was funny: I thought the writers were too lazy and I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that just to get one sad moment that lasted 3 minutes. Someone told me that episode 19 was important in showing how Spike and Jet's relationship worked and again, I don't want to pass through a boring episode like that only to see two characters exchange a few lines and pretend that I'm seeing something deep.

I think I'd have given the series a much higher rating had it been shorter and most episodes having focused on the plot and character development because when it did focus on the plot, Bebop was amazing and without a doubt those episodes had the best moments and use of music. My final verdict for Bebop is a 7 for good. It's just an action show, a good action show but just an action show. It doesn't deserve a 10 because it's not that deep nor inspiring, nor do I think it  is the masterpiece most fans of the 90's think it is and no, Bebop fans, the worst of Bebop is NOT better than the best of anime. Period. There are plenty of anime that are vastly superior to Bebop in both characterization and writing. However, as I said, it's not horrible or downright bad and it does stay with you.

    Cowboy Bebop - before you decide to watch this anime get ready to go on a serious feels trip. It may seem harmless, but it's a lot more than just a comedy - based anime. This genius work of art, coming from Shinichir Watanabe (you may know him from directing Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror or Sakamichi no Apollon, he produced all of those aswell), will take you to the realms like you've never experienced before.

Eventho the anime started airing throughout 1998, and finished in about April 1999, it had pretty decent animation I've to say. But I'd still rate it a 6, just because

          
        most of the scenes are portrayed as moving pictures, and don't any actual animation in them. But I guess that's reasonable because it was 1998 and all that shit.

Neverthless, this anime posses one thing that I rarely see in the anime made throughtout this millenium - the actual goddamn story. The story itself isn't a fascinating one I'd say, but I've enjoyed watching the fillers that cover the background story of every single character itself. The reasons why they were scarred, the reasons why they did the stuff they did, and so on. I found it so much more amusing watching the anime that was made at the end of the previous millenium that these they make nowadays tho. The animation may be poor, but you can see the actual story somewhere.

So, without further a do, as you can read in the synopsis, the whole story revolves around Spike and Jet, two bounty hunters who chase intergalactic criminals and do badass stuff all the way down to it. The anime was quite well paced I'd say, not too fast, and not too slow I guess. And yeah, the ending was perfect I'd say, just to my liking. Of course I won't spoil the ending, just saying it tho.

Oh, and so my favourite part - the OST's of this anime are really, really amazing. That opening song was easily the best one I've ever heard. Every single time I watched the opening, which I really rarely do, I mostly skip them all. The music matches the scenes so well, you just can't hate it. I mean, who doesn't love a chilly OST or an opening song? Well, that's about it, the only real thing I can complain about here is the animation, so I rated it a 6, but the whole anime overall - I rate it a pure 10.

    I try to stay away from a score of 10 as it sounds untrue as nothing is perfect but I must say after watching this.. though this review comes late it has been the closest show to making it. The story was very good at keeping you interested it did lack a backbone and you never tricked yourself into believing that the characters were in much trouble, up until the end that is and boy do I love that ending. the art is absolutely gorgeous I believe it was one of the last animes to be drawn by hand and it shows. the music I

          
        quite enjoy but if you don't like blues you might not enjoy it as much. the characters are somewhat average though I'm told it was quite new for its time and even though it is somewhat normal now they play their characters well. Overall I wholeheartedly enjoyed it and I would recommend watching it and in the dub as its one of the best dubs out there in my opinion.

    this show is a touchy subject I find with a lot of anime fans. Me myself, I had always heard of this show growing up and thought it was boring as balls. Or I was too busy watching DraginBallZ. But now that I've matured, and had the chance to buy this show and watch it to it's fullest potential, I gotta say, it was one great investment. let's jam!

Story:
Well the story of Cowboy Bebop is pretty simple, a group of bounty hunters who want to do nothing more than make enough money to at least not starve to death in the galaxy. But the other

          
        half of the story is how each character  has a past that will come back to haunt them. See the story to Bebop is both awesome and hard to get people to watch. As I had watched GRarkada's review on it before watching it, he said the first four episodes would be a snooze compared to what the other episodes had in store for you. so if you want my recommendation it will be the same as his because it worked for me. watch episodes 5, then 6, then go back and watch episodes 1-4 and watch 7 all the way to the end. Trust me, it works.

Animation:
You gotta remember this show came out in 1998 and ended in 1999 people, you aren't getting any PA works animation here. But if you look at other anime from the time the show is pretty high standard for the time. The other good note for the animation, one being my personal thing that I like, is that the animation made the character's and their look feel bluesy. Another good note worth mentioning is that the action scenes are very smooth in execution, which is great cause that is one the best parts of the show is the action. 

Sound:
The sound in Cowboy Bebop is easily where this show shines the most, not even up for debate. This is the show that has one of THE best English dubs of all time, and if it's not the best, then it damn well was the first before this dub, dubs were SHIT! Steve blum as Spike Spiegel sealed the along with Bo billanger as Jet, and the voices of faye and ed were amazing as well (forgot the actress's names.) However as good as the dub is, the music in Bebop is just as perfect as well. the show has an amazing selection of music from jazz, to blues, being the genres the show has the focal point on, to even some metal tracks, nice acoustics, you name it, it's got it. Fun fact, the names of the episodes are musically inclined as well, such as bohemian rhapsody and heavy metal queen. absolutely amazing soundtrack.

Characters:
All the characters in Bebop are very well flushed out, and all very entertaining in their own way. The main character Spike, is as badass and to the tee of the rule of cool as it comes, Faye, the chick that may not be no martial arts master, but can hold her own with her sassy attitude and sensual trickery, Jet, who is more the wiseman of the group and Ed, the hyperactive comic relief which the show needed to add some color to the Bebop crew's rather down tone sometimes. And it works perfectly because they each bounce off each other so well the chemistry is great.

My personal enjoyment:
In all honesty, as much as I praise the shit out of this show, it's not for everybody. The show is episodic so I can see why people looking for a deep plot wouldn't like it. But if your looking for something simple/epic and fun as hell characters, there is few better to watch than Bebop. overall, it's a classic, and should be viewed as such.

    I will be honest, I am not all that fond of Cowboy Bebop. I can understand why this anime is hyped as much as it is but with regards to my own personal taste in anime, its not that high up on the list. Nothing personal, just not my cup of tea. 

For me the biggest thing is, can I connect or feel some love for any of these characters and in all honesty, I couldnt. I didnt necessarily like or hate anyone character. I just felt indifferent. 

These characters are to put it simply, drifters. They dont necessarily belong anywhere else except all together.

          
        The show revolves around their bounties and along the way, pieces of the crewmates personal lives come to light. 
 I was in all honesty disappointed at how things ended with Spike especially concerning the women he loved and his former partner. It felt anti-climatic. Way too fast. You could tell we were getting their but there wasnt really any development. We got more development on Faye and Jets past, in the proper sense than we ever do with Spike. I honestly felt unsatisfied with his character development. 

The plot in general was very interesting. Its like combing the old West in Space with Jazz and Blues music which you honestly wouldnt think is a good combo but so is Gintama with space aliens and Meiji era samurai all in one mix. Some of the most surprising combinations go quite well together.
I will have to say one thing, the music was amazing. Personally speaking Im not really a big fan of this sort of music but I havent come across many anime that have such a unique musical style all their own. Its Cowboy Bebops signature.

    Story:

In the year 2071, much of the world has transferred to different planets and space crafts. Our two main characters: Spike and Jet, are bounty hunters, tracking down bounties and delivering the targets to the police to make money.

Cowboy Bebop is a collection of stories with a arcing story throughout the whole series.

Most of the stories are very well written and very dark and intense. What might put off some viewers is how slow the episodes are. Some episodes drag for little bit too long. But this recovered for the most part with episodes that are action packed and really fun.

Rating: 9

Art:

The art in Cowboy

          
        Bebop is very stylistic and gritty. The characters designs are very unique, and each character looks very different.

The whole style is also very reminiscent of noir movies from the 40s and 50s. The noir theme really gives the show its own identity.

Rating: 10

Sound:

The soundtrack for the anime is fantastic. The show uses jazz very effectively to add to the atmosphere. The opening theme "Tank" is one of the most iconic anime themes ever and for good reason, its catchy and lets you know what you are getting into.

Cowboy Bebop features one of the best dubs ever made. At many times its better the Japanese dub. The voices match perfectly to characters.

Rating: 10

Character:

The characters in Cowboy Bebop make the show really fun to watch. The characters are:

Spike, the closest character we have to a main character. He has an dark past and wants to run away from it. He has a fun personality with quick dialogue. Definitely one of the best characters.

Jet, he's the captain of the Bebop and is an ex-police officer. He has a fake arm and legs. He's very stern but also very quick and clever. He has very good dialogue with Spike and is great because of it.

Faye, coming in at episode 3, throughout the whole series Faye is probably the one who grows the most. She is cocky and mean. But really is a good person. It's always fun seeing how she is going to get out of a situation.

Edward, coming in at episode 9, Edward is 13 year old girl, who is a computer hacker and loud mouth. She is quite annoying in some cases, yet fine in others. She's a very mixed bag and feels a little out of place.

Rating: 8

Overall Rating and Enjoyment:

Cowboy Bebop is a classic, and a anime that nobody should miss. That said it isn't perfect and has many problems. My enjoyment went up and down as the series went on. But the ending is one of the best anime endings and I did feel satisfied when it ended.

    Story, Character, and Enjoyment: 10/10 Drama Llama? 
Cowboy Bebop is probably the most amazing anime I have had the privilege of watching. Even now, seven years after watching it for the first time I am having difficulty putting it into words. What is so unique about it is how the episodes don't link together, but instead mainly focus on a character or two. Director Shinichiro Watanabe did such an amazing job flushing out the characters whether the current episode shows them living their day-by-day life in the present, or delving into a certain characters unique past it really makes the Cowboy Bebop universe seem tangible.

          
        Unfortunately this is also Cowboy Bebop's downfall. Not because it's bad, but because so many people pass this by thinking it has no story. To those that think this is the case I encourage you to go back, and watch the whole thing. Not only does this anime give you the most amazing character development it manages to weave in a story along the way right under your nose. Until the last two episodes hit, then you will understand what it was all about. When it was all said and done for me my first time through, and the series came to an end, I felt like I had just witnessed my best friend get run over by a bus. Most people probably think that sounds terrible, but it takes something truly great to yank that much emotion out of you.

Animation: 10/10 Keepin' it real.
CB's animation is truly something to behold. It matches very well with the character development in making the whole series seem tangible. Character proportions are well regulated, and maintained through the whole thing. Which is very important to me in an anime. It does a much better job then huge block buster animes being released now, e.g. Naruto/Bleach.
When you speak about animation of CB you definitely have to speak of the action sequences. The gunfights, and hand-to-hand combat are superb. Spike constantly gets injured also making it seem much more realistic, and interesting. The best part though about them is there is hardly any bullshit talking interrupting   the action. I don't know about you, but I hate when two characters stop in the middle of a fight to drink some tea, and have a ten minute conversation, emo flash-back included. I could go on and on, but then what would be the point of you watching it.

Sound: 10/10 The hills are alive...
Tank! is absolutely the only anime music I will ever have included in my play-list.  Which says a lot, because normally when I start an episode of something fresh off the torrents I pretty much skip past the opening theme. That being said, CB is deeply rooted in Jazz music, but it all sounds beautiful when played side by side with the anime. I've never been much a musician, but I do know what I enjoy, and what I don't enjoy. It all sounds excellent, and I'm not a big jazz fan at all.   Not to mention Yoko Kanno mentioned to slap some Pink Floyd into episode 20, Perriot le Fou. Don't believe me? Go pop in Dark Side of the Moon, and skip to track 2.

Overall Cowboy Bebop is one big tribute to many cultures. Whether it be John Woo style gun fights, the Indian sitting in his tee-pee with his playstation, 1337 haxxors, or the Japanese's immense fear of dieing. There is a lot that Cowboy Bebop parodies while still managing to keep itself original. I'm tired of all the dime-a-dozen anime characters. E.g. the clumsy yet dormant super powerful main character, or the silent bad ass who's family died, and is in all reality an emo kid screaming out for attention. I've seen both these character types a hundred times over. This is why I idolize Cowboy Bebop, and truly believe that it is the best anime of all time.

    Widely regarded as a gateway anime for many out there, Cowboy Bebop was a critical success and during the early 2000s created a massive following in the States. Directed by the ever successful Shinichiro Watanabe (Macross Plus) and produced by the massive Studio Sunrise, the budget and talent was there to succeed.

Set in an era where mankind has colonized space and other planets, the story of Cowboy Bebop is told in the storytelling format in episodic fashion. Many anime fault the standalone episode way due to poor character development and lack thereof for any story. In the case of Bebop, this is done to almost

          
        perfection with the viewer able to jump into just about any episode. Sometimes an episode will focus on one character just to develop their character and explain their past. Our main characters are bounty hunters, referred to as cowboys in which help out tracking down criminals and such to get their payday. The achievement of this series to gain such a connection between episodes and to the characters themselves is what many other anime have trouble doing in a regular story. This speaks volumes to the high quality Bebop has.

Art and sound hits the viewer instantly when the opening to the series begins, and never lets up. Animation still holds up with some of the best ever. Compared to an anime like Outlaw Star which was running at the time shows volume to how high Bebop set the bar. Sound and music were very unique where a band was literally created for the show. Its mixture of rock, blues, and jazz somehow matches the space action, and even the drama the anime sets in between. Not many anime can honestly hold up animation or even for the music to be so memorable. Even the voice acting, whether its watched in Japanese or English, is also among the best example set in anime. Mixing in the sound effects ranging from crazy gun fights to the waves hitting rocks in the sea, almost everything in this anime is done to almost perfection.

Considered an anime classic, it is hard to argue why. The only fault that Cowboy Bebop has is the lack of a continuous story, but thats not what this sci-fi western adventure is. If that isnt what a fan is into then still give Cowboy Bebop a chance at the very least. There is so much to love and being one of the most watched anime of all time, its easy to see why.

    Cowboy Bebop is a good choice for you if you're looking for some well animated action series, where you don't have to follow along on an overarching plot, and prefer to kick back to some episodic stories. If you dislike episodic structures, note that Cowboy Bebop does develop its characters, but very slowly, and has continuity in its universe, but its structure relies on building any story it wants with the cast for the most part, while defining the traits of who those characters are. It doesn't promise you anything for the next episode it will deliver. And note that if you dislike when a

          
        series isn't particularly colorful, Cowboy Bebop's animation might not come off as well animated, since it's an old anime and stuff didn't use to be very colorful back then.

You see, modern day  anime rely a lot on being colored puddles of puke, where they assort everything with plenty of colors, but without paying particular attention to how it contrasts with everything, and how the viewer will notice the particular details presented in it. It is easy to sell and hook someone with something that is easy on the eye to simply become eyecandy. However, both the cinematography and animation here is what shines, with the series making good use of lightning and camera angles to create really interesting shots and engaging fights. It also paid attention to the motion of the characters, and to certain small details that give the animation life, such as the trembling of someone who is holding a gun in their hands when nervous, as an example. But what I appreciate most about it is the fact that it knows exactly how much detail to put into each shot, as it didn't have the technology or budget to simply build gargantuous images. Rather, it knew how to animate exactly what we'd be paying attention to. Rather than constantly pay attention to the landscape and constantly create beautiful scenery nobody will really focus on, it chooses on focusing on the details that are relevant to the movement of the characters, like the lightning of the shadows, the way things break upon impact and other such little details that make each action scene be more engaging. In other words, it has a great sense in what is relevant to present in a scene, over what would make it look more pretty and it focuses on substance rather than appeal.

The structure of the anime was episodic, mostly focusing on delivering action romps, while developing certain details about the world and its space setting. It did focus on the characters occasionally, but it mostly relied on being capable of using their default state to create some episodic action setpieces. While it is indeed episodic I do want to compliment Cowboy Bebop that it follows an episodic structure that I'd deem respectable. It doesn't promise you it will get somewhere necesarily, as it doesn't have a clear defined end goal for an overarching plot and that's good, because you won't feel like the episode you are watching is a mere waste of time due to the fact it does not progress the plot. But it also has continuity with the characters undergoing some events that give them motivations, but in a way that doesn't break their intended roles, so they can used as a formula. So not everything is gonna be constant and could go through some slight changes at any time which can hook the viewer, but it will never have the risk to break familiarity. It doesn't lie about what it tries to deliver unlike some anime that present you an overarching plot, while taking a lot of side trips that only artificially progress to the end goal of the plot. Cowboy Bebop merely tries to entertain, and that's it. As far as you can expect from it, expect anything, but with the only constant being action and/or suspense that get solved under 20 minutes.

How it tries to entertain is simply by delivering some good looking action scenes in an interesting setting. Personally, the setting kinda took away a bit of my enjoyment, merely because the understanding of space that we had when Cowboy Bebop was produced, as well as certain tropes that existed then, is far different to that of the current day. As an example, someone got worried about some explosives flying in space and said it would be a great threat to travelers, but how would explosives ignite in a place with no oxygen, like space. So when you watch Cowboy Bebop, you have to twist your view of scifi a little bit, as the futuristic setting imagined is far different to our preset one now. Things such us not expecting to colonize planets such as Mars and Venus, that happened in Cowboy Bebop, which are uninhabitable planet, might sound to you as a little far fetched with no explanations. The novelty of the setting is absent, but it is charming in the way of "so that's how people thought this was gonna turn out" kind of way. And the setting itself doesn't really take away from either the drama or the action pieces presented in the episodes.

Personally, I consider Cowboy Bebop to be one of the best possible results out of old fashioned anime. In terms of detail, it tries to liven its world up by bringing up small details in the movement and good cinematography, which give it great artistic value. Maybe you won't get something incredibly colorful or as detailed as something that can be animated today, but it is animated in a way that the key elements someone would focus on shine through. In terms of writing, it creates any story it wants at any point, while also being capable of progressing its characters forward. It knows what ground rules to set and how to leave them open ended enough to be potentially interesting for a larger group of people, which is how something commercially viable was aimed back then, rather than subgroups. But it does so in a manner that does not seem like pandering to the masses, because of the fact that it is diversified enough. And I think they did the best with the setting they've created as they possibly could've done at the time it was created. Frankly, I think it is at its maximum potential of what it strived to be, and that is what I found most appealing upon rewatching. That all the criticisms I could deliver are merely due to its age, from mentality of the characters, to animation and the way it was delivered. 

Now that doesn't mean any concerns about it are unvalidated. It is episodic so you won't follow through on a sound story with a beginning, middle and an end, but rather, a bunch of adventures meant to entertain. Some people prefer to see the bigger picture for entertain value, rather than focus on tangents, and in Bebop, while there may not be such things as tangents, there's no such thing as a bigger picture either. Some people might not enjoy something merely due to the fact that it contains action and suspense, so those details can get lost on you quite easily and Cowboy Bebop immediately losing its value. And the setting itself hasn't aged as well as other things in science fiction, and if you can't watch it from the perspective of novelty, or accept some of its shortcomings because it was novelty at the time, the setting won't hold much value. But I personally can't help but respect Bebop and consider it good. It tried its best to be as innovative as it could, while also trying to appeal to everyone by following a structure that will allow change but a lot of constants in it as well and the animation was done in a manner that the shortcomings of the era don't really take away from it, outside of a few dated animation techniques that won't hold today and don't really get used much.

Cowboy Bebop is one of the best things that could've aired in the late 90's. But is it one of the best things that you could watch today? That's the question you should answer yourself, when deciding to watch Cowboy Bebop. I strongly recommend watching Bebop from an artistical sense, if you're a fan of good animation or anime in general, to see what's the highest potential an animated series of that age could achieve in that department. But whether or not you will be entertained by it, strictly depends on you, as the value of it can vary from episode to episode, and its setting is dated enough for you to create your own inconsistencies. Frankly, the question is as simple as this: Do you generally enjoy short selfconcluded action stories?

    Okay, I may be a bit suspicious to talk about the work, maybe I overdid it in the notes, no, I do not believe that, but okay, I'll start
I love this anime a lot, and it's funny how I get myself thinking about the work, about the different themes covered and, of course, the sad but great ending, the end of the series really complies with the word, it's an end, you feel complete , May have a taste of want more, but to see that the 26 episodes were satiating
The universe of Cowboy Bebop is very well built, it is already a time when

          
        space exploration worked, year 2071 (Unfortunately that year there will be no colony by the Solar System), Bounty Hunters earn a living in this new profession, In a new way of living
The art, as well as other animes of the 90's is fantastic, I find incredible the air that these styles bring, movements, in the action scenes are mainly fluid, and even the expressions of characters fascinate, this looking at every detail of scene, Without mentioning the very good animation that heaven possesses
The music is something else the fantastic part, starting from the opening, Tank! Like other songs that play during the series, and that curiously has a style of Jazz well pulled for the Bebop, and the fantastic music of closing, The Real Folk Blues, same name of the last two episodes, in addition the name of the episodes always has the See with music, and this is too interesting
And what to talk about the characters, my every character very well built, you play a character, and with the passing of the episodes you will know more of each one, the characteristic past of each and what is good, the outcome, Episode for episode You know each character, and I come to talk about the specific episodes of Jet and Faye, first Jet's, which are very engaging and serious, I love the rhythm of these episodes, Faye's, to know about her past Is very good, and I see that these specific episodes of Faye kind of sad because the history of her past is, I will not comment anything, if you want to know you have to watch, not to mention the other main characters like Spike that is a great Protagonist and Ed who is the hyperactive child, can not dislike it, in fact, there is no way to dislike anyone, even Ein, the dog is super charismatic (but I think all dogs are) secondary characters Which appear, such as Andy, Appledelhi (I think is the strongest character in the anime) and Tongpu (His story is very interesting)
The Rhythm of the anime really runs very well, I recommend it to everyone ..........

    Cowboy bebop is, in my opinion the best show to ever air on television. It is one of 2 shows I think are perfect.
Story:10/10
 The story is unique and very creative. Most of it is told by flashbacks and you learn more about the past of the show as it goes along. It does it perfectly.
Art:10/10
 The art is amazing. Most old anime have an art style I don't really care for,(trigun for example.) but this is just awsome. The spaceships look unique, the character designs are wonderful, the way the drew everything is just awsome.
Sound:10/10
Nothing needs to be said here. Even if you haven't

          
        seen this you have heard of the phenomenal soundtrack.
Character:10/10
The characters could not have been more perfect. Thayer are all likable, and the development on them is very impressive. As the show goes along, you learn more about their back stories that will make you appreciate them much more.

    Overlooked classic I never watched lived up to it's fame and a OST I fell in love with.

Story: Bounty Hunters in space, while this isn't something that has been touched in fiction before I feel it does it the best. At times it's vague, which it doesn't need to be detailed with certain characters past not being completely explained till later adds to the mystery of some of them and the over all events that lead them meeting each came together pretty well. Had the right amount of comic relief and tension not many shows I feel do it this well no over zealous comedy

          
        and it was serious when it needed to be.

Art: For it's time the art is top notch, the environments are well designed, characters aren't all copy-pasted templates they are unique looking. Gives a nice mixture of the wild west, and space mashed together.

Sound: I loved the OST so much I ended up getting it for myself. I'm a fan of jazz, and Cowboy Bebop does it well. The opening song is pretty spicey and smooth got to say it's one of my favorite Opening OSTs to date. Tank, Rush, Space Lion, etc never get's old listening to them.

Characters: The main characters work well together, from the chaos to the sad moments it feels like one of the better choices for bunching them together. Even a lot of side characters weren't dull and many times I was wishing I would see some again. 

Probably the best space bounty anime there is, and it left me wanting a little bit more feeling it ended to quickly.

    For those who haven't caught any of the show or the hype, Cowboy Bebop initially involves just two guys, Spike and Jet, who are trying to make a living as interstellar bounty hunters. They travel from system to system trying to earn rewards for bringing in various and sundry criminals in their heap of a spaceship named the Bebop. As their journeys continue, we learn more about their pasts--Jet's life as a cop, and Spike's membership in a crime syndicate--while they meet up with others who become a part of their crew. Faye Valentine's a selfish but beautiful gal who occasionally works with the guys

          
        when not gambling or trying to understand the memories of her past that have gone missing. Ed's a she that looks like a he that can hack into any computer system, providing she doesn't giggle and goofytalk her way into oblivion. And Ein's a good-natured data dog with as much personality as his companions in just a simple woof. A ragtag bunch if we've ever seen one, the five nevertheless wind up capturing the imagination and hearts of their audience easily during their 26 episodes of adventures.

I have never seen an animated television series look so fantastic. Almost every episode of Bebop rivals theatrical animation, trouncing on OVAs that supposedly have better budgets. It looks amazing. The soundtrack by Yoko Kanno, a jazz fusion blend, is immediately catchy, but it has surprising depth, enough that the CD has become a regular companion. If you like animation at all, you'll have to see Bebop. And, frankly, it doesn't matter if you are a subtitle purist or a dub fan, because both versions are fantastic. I watch subs almost exclusively, and I got hooked on the dub. That just doesn't happen to me, but it did here. It's that good.

But beyond that, the show has a style and colorfulness lacking in too many anime. True, some shows like Hellsing are drenched in style, but that's all they are. Cowboy Bebop is cool without ever having to rely on attitude alone to see it through. Although I tend to prefer shows with plotlines that build on each other, Bebop grows our affection for the characters through mostly stand-alone episodes. There is back-story to be told, and it's told well, but rarely do shows without a strong story arch feel so natural. It shouldn't be as powerful as it is, but it's a testament to good storytelling.

Then there's that wonderful history and the drastic ending (which I won't spoil here, though I'll discuss it below under the main review). I'm reminded when watching Cowboy Bebop of the tagline from the beautifully haunting film Magnolia: "We may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with us." Bebop is effective because each character has such a rich history before the stories here even begin that they are fully realized in every way. Sadly, in most anime, characters exist only to fulfill plot purposes, rather than existing as entities unto themselves. In fact, Bebop works because we go through the entire show, right up to its conclusion, without knowing everything there is to know about these folks. They are motivated by issues that the writers developed that we don't even fully understand. That lends a reality to the characters that makes them far more enjoyable than we expect. When their pasts catch up with them, we care.

This leads us to the controversial part...the last few episodes that wrap everything up. The events of those episodes are cataclysmic, to say the least. For American audiences, they can mar the experience, even. (As one friend said to me, "Now that I've watched the whole thing, the last couple episodes make me sad, in a way, that I did.") But they are very Japanese, encapsulating the ambiguity and realism that set the very best anime apart. I believe that they make the show even more authentic and worthy. At the same time, the only thing that keeps me from giving the show an A+ is that the ending doesn't have the emotional impact it should because we just don't know quite enough back-story yet for it to work. We are left with too many questions. Again, I attribute it to the fact that Japanese stories are rife with ambiguity. But this one could have stood just a little bit less.

That being said, Cowboy Bebop is easily in my list of "best anime ever". If you like anime, you should see it. Period. Normally, I use my final paragraph to sum it all up, but that says it all. You should see it.

    Cowboy Bebop has been, since it's release in 1998, the bar by which every new anime series is judged by. It's just that good. Many have described it as 1970's cop show-meets western-meets high-quality drama-meets film-noir, and I am gonna have to agree with them.
Cowboy Bebop revolves around futuristic bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, and the series is really just their exploits through the universe. Along the way, they meet female bounty hunter Faye Valentine, computer hacker Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th (simply Ed for short), data dog Ein, and various bounties and figures from their past.
The beauty of Cowboy Bebop is

          
        that although the show does have a recurring story based around Spike's past, this is more or less tossed aside for "filler" episodes, or one episode storylines. Through filler episodes, we make a very strong bond and attachment to these characters, and it makes the ending to it all the more heartfelt.
When I watch Cowboy Bebop, I really do feel what happens to the characters. You feel sympathy and plight, happiness and joy, sadness and sorrow. You care about the characters, and I commend the staff who worked on the series for doing this. Very few anime series have characters for whom you can actually relate to, build bonds to emotionally, and frankly, give a damn about. Cowboy Bebop pulls it off with elegance and grace, as if it were nothing.
All in all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever created, hands down. it has excellent characters, wonderful storylines, beautiful animation, and mesmorizing locales. It remains to be one of my favorites of all time.

    First review; bear with me. Now I'm sure this anime has been done to death, but reviewing it was irresistible since it was one of the first animes I watched, thus making a pretty lasting impression on me. Cowboy Bebop provided an extremely smooth transition from familiar American cartoons to a literally foreign arena. This show takes action to a new level, with a plethora of heart palpitating adventures which not only delve into the blatant physical aspects of the characters and setting, but the development of interpersonal relationships amongst them.

For those unfamiliar with Cowboy Bebop, the entire show is essentially the prologue to a

          
        main story that the audience never explicitly discovers. That being said, there are ups and downs to this plot set up. One of the more commendable aspects is the show's lack of straightforward obviousness in several areas, despite apparent inter-galactic shootouts and dog fights. This is especially noted in the character development of Spike and Faye, as well as the bond between them. At first glance, Spike is your stereotypical uninterested protagonist emitting a cool aura, while Faye is a rogue heroine bad ass if you will. You would expect a fairly predictable relationship between them following the lines of an abrupt love forming... Yadda yadda. However, a more subtle form of trust and understanding blossoms between them not through cheesy confessions, or transparent words, but exhilarating action! What better way to convey love is there?

That being said, predictability isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mind-numbing action probably isn't the ideal form of entertainment for some of you more analytic audiences, but the simplicity of the show made it easy to follow and more enjoyable. Missing an episode won't leave you puzzled and without important information, since you're basically guaranteed a complete adventure every episode, which leads me to my last point.

The creators of Cowboy Bebop went a little far with the whole idea of it being a prologue, and in certain instances, there were a lot of cases of ambiguity. The three main characters of course are given some sort of backstory, however not all of it was logically explained. For example, Spike's relationship with the main villain is described as once being on the same side, and now they hate each other, but not how exactly they got to that point. 

Overall Cowboy Bebop has minor issues, but they certainly don't overshadow the immense entertainment, and joy the show brings to any audience. An excellent starter anime, and timeless classic.

    Overview:
As one of the most famous anime of the 1990's, "Cowboy Bebop" is a show that needs no introduction. With that in mind, there is almost no need to write this review other than to state my own personal opinion. With its smooth, detailed animation, highly unique music style, awesome action scenes, flawless voice acting and quirky yet lovable characters, "Cowboy Bebop" is a brilliant crime fiction/space western series that deservedly became an instant classic.

Story & World (8.5/10):
The series takes place in the year 2071, roughly sixty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth uninhabitable. Because of this incident, humanity has

          
        colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as "Cowboys") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The crew of the titular spaceship Bebop are a group of such bounty hunters. Originally, the crew consists only of our main character, Spike Spiegel and his partner Jet Black, but with the first nine episodes, three new members join the crew. The series has a largely episodic nature that follows this group of misfits hunting down criminals while also covering their day-to-day lives.

One thing you'll notice is that the crew hardly ever get the bounties, often screwing things up by ultimately killing the person or having something else happen. Unfortunately, as you can guess, this can get a bit repetitive, as you begin to expect that they'll end up risking their lives and get absolutely nothing for their trouble. Now and again, however, the show does see them capturing bounties alive, just to show that they're actually good at what they do. And when I say 'a bit repetitive', I mean 'a bit', as the episodes have a wide variety of genres, including film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, buddy-buddy stories, parody and everything in between. One episode might be extremely funny while the next could be highly bleak or unsettling. 

Largely, however, the show doesn't really have a story. While there is two story arcs, they only really come in when needed and often go several episodes without being touched upon. I felt that Spike's arc, which focuses on his past as a criminal, was quite underdeveloped as a lot of things aren't really made clear. Thankfully, I can say that the ending of the series as a whole is absolutely fantastic.

Art & Animation (9/10):
"Cowboy Bebop"'s animation is extremely smooth. While there are better-looking anime out there, the fights are brilliantly choreographed and, for a hand-drawn series, the characters and environments are all incredibly detailed, with everyone and everything having a distinct appearance. All of this creates a fantastic-looking anime that still holds up even to this day. Considering the show first aired in the late 90s, that is quite an accomplishment.

Sound & Dialogue (10/10):
My God, the music is absolutely fantastic! It is a very unique style that really fits the tone of the series. I cannot think of a single other anime that uses jazz music, and it's used to full effect here. There is only one opening and one ending theme ('Tank!' and 'The Real Folk Blues', respectively) but they are both two of the best themes for an anime I have ever seen. The voice acting is just as good, with the English dub being known for one-upping the Japanese original. I especially like Steven Blum and Wendee Lee's performances as Spike and Faye, respectively. The former has a really cool voice which really fits Spike's laid-back personality and the latter pulls off Faye's feminine charming perfectly. The script is great as well, largely thanks to Spike's brilliant snarky quips.

Characters (9/10):
The Bebop crew can be summed up as follows- the grumpy, sarcastic guy (Spike), the femme fatale (Faye), the wise mentor (Jet), the dog (Ein) and the kid (Ed, who is a girl, btw). However, there is far, far more to them than just that. Spike is a former criminal haunted by the lost of a loved one, Faye is an amnesiac con artist, Jet is a former cop with a robot arm and acts as Spike's foil, Ein is a lab experiment to create a very intelligent dog and Ed is an expert hacker with a... very odd thought pattern.

All of the Bebop crew have their moments in the sun, with various episodes focusing on a specific member. Spike's past catches up to him and he forced to face off against his former best friend-turned-enemy Vicious (more on him later), Faye attempts to recover her lost memory and Jet is forced to deal with various issues from his past as a cop. Ed and Ein don't get as much focus as the core trio, and the episodes that focus on them tend to be very comical.

All of the Bebop crew are lovable in their own ways, but Spike and Faye are by far the most developed. Ed and Ein remain pretty much the same throughout the entire series and while Jet goes through several instances of cleaning up his own past, it doesn't really affect his outlook and lifestyle, with him still being the same gruff but gentle giant. Spike and Faye, on the other hand, are the focus of the major story arcs of the series, with Spike looking for his lost love and settling his score with Vicious and Faye attempting to recover her memory and find her place in the universe. While they remain rather grumpy and unpleasant even to the end, they do definitely care for each other and their shipmates. Plus, they (along with Jet) can more than hold their own in a fight.

This brings us to the main villain, Vicious, a ruthless crime lord who most certainly lives up to his name, as he is notorious for betraying anybody even remotely close to him. He also has legendary skill with a katana, to the point that he manages to make a sword vs. gun fight between him and Spike seem fair, albeit with a bit of cheating on his part. He appears in a total of five episodes and is the only recurring antagonist in the series. That said, some other villains do leave lasting impression even though they only appear in one episode. That is very difficult to do. 

Enjoyment (9.5/10):
Due to the variety in the episodes, you are unlikely to ever be bored while watching "Cowboy Bebop". Even if you aren't a big fan of anime, you can still really enjoy this series due to it being largely Western-styled. Some of the episodes, however, especially the last four, are very unsettling and may put off some people. Others, on the other hand, are incredibly funny, so essentially there's something here for everyone.

Overall:
The fact that "Cowboy Bebop" is just as popular today as it was when it first aired nearly twenty years ago easily cements its status as a timeless classic, and, having watched it myself, I can easily see why. Fluid animation, awesome music and memorable characters make this one of my favourite anime thus far. If, by any chance, you haven't watched this series, I would recommend you do so as soon as possible.

Score:
8.5+9+10+9.5+9=46/50=9.2/10

    Looking for an anime mixed with futuristic bounty hunters and jazz?  Then this one is for you.  Cowboy Bebop is overall, one of my favorite animes ever.  Perhaps you're saying to yourself, the rating is a bit exaggerated.  But this is not the case, allow me to explain myself.

Story: A very original, and heart-pounding story.  One that tells a story of love, hate, and overall pure excitement!

Art: Perhaps not the best of it's time, but certainly among them.  Cowboy Bebop delivers very beautiful artwork, especially with all the images of the future.

Sound: Both the Japanese and English tracks were

          
        filled with great voice acting.  Also the sounds hit dead on perfection.  The interesting part about Cowboy Bebop is it's close relation to the jazz genre.  Much enjoyment of the sound from the brilliant artist Yoko Kanno.

Character: This was a huge plus for Cowboy Bebop.  The characters showed a very unique aura in their own way.  Matching very well with the atmosphere of Cowboy Bebop.  Spike being the main protagonist, also showing very mixed emotions showing much humor.

Enjoyment: I very well enjoyed Cowboy Bebop.  Perhaps it was the queer attitude of some characters, or the total hilarious moments.  It's one anime I can watch over and over again, and still enjoy.

Overall:  Cowboy Bebop is an amazing anime which will hold a place in my heart forever.  Not only did I love it, but it played a big part in my life as well.  It's a great show for people of all ages.  Mixing classic jazz, futuristic bounty hunters, and great fight scenes.  Cowboy Bebop is one anime i would recommend to anyone.

    I hear so often from ppl saying Cowboy Bebop is the "absolute best" anime ever made. maybe 10 years ago, but Cowboy Bebop is soooo far from that title now. So my post here will be blatantly contrasted from this point of view to compensate, rather than being more of a middle ground review that i otherwise might have written.

I think most ppl are still inflating the ratings on this series due to it being a landmark or a breakthrough. it can hardly be argued to keep it in that position after so may great other animes have come out. Take Samurai Champloo alone, which

          
        is done by the same director, has the same format, and even uses the same type of character molds. that is clearly way more amazing (not just cz of modern graphics but in many many other respect as well) than CB. 

 It's not "so cool" it's as typical as an anime can get. People say just chilling out in space, and doing fun episodic things is so amazing and novel, but it's totally not! it's the most overdone setting ever. I just don't understand why ppl think it's so new. Despite all that, if a series is still enjoyable, then hey, what works works, but Cowboy Bebop didn't blow me away in this department either. My level of enjoyment was pretty average, if not below. 

and no, the charcter development is not outstanding either. many other animes do a way better job. that buff older guy is hardly developed. only the girl is somewhat interesting. the younger kid is just weird that it makes her seem a non-person. Spice and Wolf, K-On, Lucky Star, Samurai Champloo, even Bleach for many of the characters (not all) have better character development than Cowboy Bebop.

setting original? give me a break! space travelers. bounty hunters? how more commonplace can you get?
(metroid)

space :
legend of galactic heroes, stargate, 

no plot, character driven (supposedly):
samurai champloo, lucky star, k-on

bounty:
one piece, star wars


Samurai Champloo has a similar format as this but actually IS "so cool". the atmosphere, the aura, the music actually is great. cowboy bebop is a pale attempt that doesn't cut it the way Samurai Champloo does

cowboy bebop fans, there is no way this series deserves to be on the pedestal that it has been placed on surprisingly. There's nothing unique about this, there's nothing ultra novel about it. Why do you insist that it is?

    "And the work which has become a genre upon itself is called: Cowboy Bebop." It's hard not to raise a skeptical eyebrow at the cocksure bravado displayed in the statement, and one might be tempted to proceed with the intent to smash this assertion, as well as the overwhelming praises this show has received, into pieces. 

Except it was entirely justified. 

Sure, Cowboy Bebop is actually a pastiche of genres heavily influenced by classic American films; spaghetti western, space road trip, gangland crime drama, buddy comedy, etc. But through amalgamation of these narrative elements, it has morphed into a unique creation with tremendous amount of

          
        polish and flair, consisted of wildly varied bounty-of-the-week episodes and punctuated by  individual character arcs that end up becoming the series' highlights.  

What the show did with its characters are truly special. They started off as strangers to the audience and to each other (except for Spike and Jet, who are already acquainted in the beginning), only to gradually reveal fascinating layers of personality and history. There's no big drama or obvious bonding scenes between them, but as they bickered, cooperated, and told stories to each other, a subtle  bond is formed throughout the show and I couldn't help but be emotionally invested at their fates. It is through these characters, particularly in the different ways they react to their past demons (*a recurring motif), that the series got the substance to go along with its dazzling style. The writing of the show also made excellent use of symbolism and thematic delivery through subtle means; it's never distracting nor overly obtuse, and it's there to reward those actively looking to unravel more from the narrative.  

Much has already been said about series director Shinichiro Watanabe, screenwiter Keiko Nobumoto, and composer Yoko Kanno, so I'm pretty much just preaching to the choir here, but I'll say it anyway:  this is one hell of a team, and we're lucky to have them in the anime industry. Th their vision, the world of Bebop is a rich, diverse,cornucopia of colorful characters set against the backdrop of sweet gorgeous music. I'm not a fan of jazz, and normally I don't even pay much attention to a show's given oST unless it's really exceptional or really terrible, but the composition and performance in this show is really something else. The Seatbelts, a multi-national and heavily instrumental band spearheaded by Kanno, contributed an incredible variety and quantity of stuff that became integral in setting the mood, whether it's the extremely iconic instrumental OP in Tank!, the gorgeous wordless vocal in ELM,  the haunting lyric of Call Me to accompany one of the most heart-breaking scenes in any anime, or the somber jazz piece of Space Lion, just to name a few examples from a (very) deep list. 

I couldn't find it in me to give me a perfect score; my enjoyment of the stand-alone episodes are uneven, and the show never really sustained a sense of momentum until the final three episodes. I could also see someone watching this for the first time and find it to not really be that compelling, but it's important to note that Cowboy Bebop really became something special through repeat viewings, where one is more attuned to observe the homages, foreshadowing, and hidden nuggets of information in even the least consequential episode. Bottom line, if you're looking for something with serious entertainment and artistic merits, you owe it to yourself to watch this. Twice, at least.

    Overview-10/10
The story of Cowboy Bebop is the misadventures of a group of space cowboys/bounty hunters with a rift of humor, drama, adventure, action and sci-fi that blend together well with old-time jazz backtracks. From the genius of Shinichiro Watanabe was where this space adventure sprang from and it is an old gem I will always love! And the end is a cliffhanger, leaving you wondering what happened

Art-10/10
Watanabe puts some great thought into the appearance of his charachters. They are intricatey designed to fit their persona. Spike Spiegel, our cool-as-ice, sharply dressed hero had a great design with tones of blue and yellow. Perfect compliment!

Sound-9/10
The voice

          
        actors in the dub (which I usually watch to get a clear picture in my head for my fanfics) are perfect, for the most part. Steve Blum, one of my all time fave voice actors, plays Spike Spiegel, and Wendee Lee plays the sexy and daring Faye Valentine. Their voices are well-suited. The jazzy backing music made for a mysterious and mellow environment, as well as spazzy chase scenes. The ending theme, the real folk blues

Charachters-10/10
The charachters are intricate and have very good backstories, be they major or one timers. Spike's romance with a beautiful blonde and rivalry with an old comerade are riveting to watch.


Parental Warnings

Violence-Strong
There are brutal shootings, combat, and fistfights strewn throughout, but nothing too terribly gory.

Language-Moderate
Swearing here and there, but nothing much

Sex/Nudity-Mild
There are a few sex references and jokes, as well as a brief gay love scene

Frightening/Intense scenes-Moderate
There is a scene where someone is beat up, as well as several deaths

    Bebop is one of the best animes of all time. Loaded with action, comedy, drama, romance, all in a sci-fi setting; it is a classic. Best english dub ever... I don't think I've ever seen an entire episode in Japanese.

Memorable characters. Spike is my favorite anime character of all time; my Spike Spiegel Messenger Bag might just be one of the best purchases I've ever made.

Awesome music. I listen to the soundtrack every single day. The jazz is amazing, as only Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts could make such a spectacle. It's the main reason for my favorite radio station being CD101.9

    Hey there space cowboy/girl!!



Today Ill be reviewing Cowboy Bebop. It wasnt that long ago that I was sceptical with the quality an anime from the 90s could produce. Of course my doubts were put to bed with the likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion.



So the story revolves around Spike a bounty hunter who travels around on a spaceship called Bebop with his partner Jet who owns the ship. Together the two go around looking for bounty heads to cash in on, though more often then not failing to succeed. Along the way we have the addition of Faye and Radical Edward who join in

          
        on the shenanigans.



Dont let the brief above fool you into thinking this is a happy-go-lucky bounty hunt full of comical failures. Oh no, you are in for a much better surprise than that. Cowboy Bebop has a good thing going, it has its priorities set straight from the get go and builds on it for the continuation of the series. The main characters get a great deal of screen time and have entire episodes dedicated for their back stories which few shows do now-a-days.



Lets turn our attention to the characters. Now Im not going to go out of my way to hail the cast of Cowboy bebop AMAZING but the characters are very enjoyable. Spike is a old fashioned bad-ass, he always seem to get the job done in the end, but not with ease as the show portrays his flaws and the effort he has to put in so that things go his way. Spike is simply that cool guy you wanted to be in high school and not because he was a douche bag who bullied guys and skipped class to smoke, but because he is an all-round honourable and respectable man. Next is Jet he is that authority figure he is short tempered and very grumpy, but inside hes just a softie. He is a likeable character and usually does the right thing. His story arc wasnt that favourable to the other characters, but I still liked Jet as a whole. Next up is Faye. She takes the role of a femme-fatale. She is bitchy, hot-headed and a compulsive gambler. On top of that her memories were forgotten while she was in cryogenic freezing. Giving her story arc the annoying I NEED TO KNOW WHO I AM. Kind of story arc which is annoying. Faye does however have her moments and I liked her. Finally we have Ed. She came along later in the series as the geeky, hyperactive computer hacker who doesnt know any better. Ed is that bit of comic relief on the side. She lightens the tone and occasionally will give you a chuckle because she is just adorable.



The art in the series is great for its time, in comparison to todays standards it is appalling but again it came out in the late 90s so you cant really fault the show. The sound is very jazzy, well thats what I gathered from the opening and it continues throughout the show as it fits in with the western tone of the series.



Enjoyment, this plays a great part in this show as whether you enjoy the cowboy themes will be a contributing factor on whether the series does it for you or not. I found this to be very enjoyable the action scenes were fluent and exciting. The sci-fi elements also make it a good watch for fans of that genre, it does appeal to a relatively large audience. Those who dont enjoy the series probably prefer the romance or magical girl/fantasy genre. Most people will find something to enjoy about the series



Overall Cowboy Bebop was a fun ride I thoroughly enjoyed the series and although not every episode was spectacular there are things to give merit for. Id also like to point out the ridiculously spontaneous episode 11. For those old fashioned, wannabe cowboys this is a must watch. Overall the series was an 8/10 and gets a definite recommendation from me.



See you space cowboy

    What did I think of Cowboy bebop... WELL down right one of my favorite anime's because of its outstanding work on adventure comedy and plots through each episode that always kept me entertained. When i first heard about the anime and its accusations of being one of the best anime's ever by some reviews I was curious about it, what brought me closer is that it was made around the time I myself was born.As I  saw this the plots of each different episode were always there keeping me watching it from begging to end with its awesome music (intro and outro)  written

          
        by Yoko Kanno and performed by the Seatbelts that always had me hyped and so into it. I loved most every aspect of it and would recommend this amazing anime to any searching for a fun comedy, a badass sci fi, or some mystery type deal with a dramatic past. This anime deserves a 10 out of 10 (especially since it was made in 1998)

    This is my First Review! I never watched anime until i took an anime film course last semester and for our research paper we had to choose an anime series. I chose the show Cowboy Bebop as ive heard of its praise, and i was blown away. I was so impressed by the characters, the inner struggles and backstory of Spike, Jet, and Faye and watching them grow and develop was so engaging, the narrative structure was complex and refreshing and it was just so Stylish! from the opening all the way to the end. i wasnt even a fan of jazz until i watched

          
        this show, the jazz/blues theme plays through every scenario in the show and compliments the characters and visuals very well. Cowboy bebop so far is the most Complete story ive seen and i am constantly recommending it to people that refuse to watch anime because they say "its just cartoons", let them watch this they will be impressed. I am now addicted to anime and have watched a couple of shows since this and im glad i was introduced to a whole new genre of tv and film. By the way you will get hooked on the soundtrack so here are some of the names of the songs you will download.
Tank - (opening theme)
Goodnight Julia
Space lion
The Real Folk Blues - (end theme)
.....Your welcome!

    Warning :Minor Spoilers ahead
Ok, it's been a while since i saw this anime in top 30 anime list. Looking at the year it was aired I wasn't really interested to watch it. But after some friends recommend it to me and after I read sooo many reviews that give ten to Cowboy Bebop, I decided to watch it. At that time I was tired of animes that show too much moe, ecchi, and other stuff and I'll try the claasic ones. And.. It was..

Story : (7/10)
Ok, it has very interesting setting, a futuristic world where people have started living in other planets. Our MCs here,

          
        are bounty hunters who have their own unique past. Interesting setting right? Unfortunately, the execution of the story can't deliver it to the audience very well. Cowboy Bebop is  too episodic which almost each episode has each own story. And from this episodic episodes, huge conflicts are only in 5 episodes or something ( if I remember it correctly). I wouldn't mind if other episodes are exciting, but most of it are flat and seems useless. You can even throw some episodes away and it doesn't affect the main story. Watching Cowboy Bebop makes me tired of waiting about Spike's past and what will happen to him and Vicious. I have to watch some uninteresting and some useless episodes before i got to see it. It makes me bored. well, but Spike's story was amazing so I think it's worth waiting.   

Art : (8/10)
Art is very good. I like the character designs. Animation was amazing and makes me wonder if it really was made in 90's.

Sound : (8/10)
Nice OST

Enjoyment : (7/10)
Like I said before, it is hard to enjoy Bebop because some episodes seem useless and feel like filler. Some episodes are just plain and don't excite me. I can really enjoy only a few episodes.

Overall : (7/10)
Overall, 7. It was interesting, but it wasn't exciting. Main concept is very good, but too many plain episodes. Maybe because it's classic, some rate it very high (mostly 10). But I don't want too rate it according to the time it was made. I won't divide anime between classic or not. I was also confused to rate it whether 7 or 8. I chose 7 finally. I think it deserves 8. But to me, 8.83 seems little overrated. But well, for those retro anime fans, I'm sorry. People have different opinion sometimes, right?

    Cowboy Bebop directed by Shinchiro Watanabe is one of, if not the best anime that has ever been made. You can call it unoriginal, predictable and you can say that the story is too rigid. The thing is, no other anime has done something like this with so much style and finesse. 

When I decided to write this review the best thing I could compare it to for me, was the video game The Last of Us, one of the most critically acclaimed and best games of all time. The story, the writing, the characters all kinda cliche, but what it does is perfect it

          
        like no other work in the medium has. But saying this, the last of us has been out for a year and who knows when it will be beaten. Bebop has lasted for over fifteen years as the most beautiful and artistically, for the lack of better words, 'nailed it'. I emplore anyone who loves anime to watch this before they die, because no one has or will recreated the magic of Bebop.

    Cowboy Bebop: Spoiler free review

A truly surreal expirence to be had, Cowboy Bebop blends copious and subtle amounts of almost every genre.
A picturesque expirence teeming with euphoria and a wonderful sense of adventure. The world is uniquley crafted
and truly feels like its own.

Story 7/10 Cowboy bebop has an interesting concept of potraying it's story.
Being an episodic adventure, sure each episode has a different plot, but intertwined is segments from the character's pasts, taking us into the present to be projected into the future.
There is very little and a lot going on all at once spanned over this 26 episodic escapade!
Simply put; we start in the

          
        present, slowly unveil the past, and follow the characters into their future.

Characters 7.5/10 Cowboy Bebop is more character interaction than character
development, and the interactions are well composed. The main characters have a lot of major differences,
but that is not to say they fit well together. They bring out the best and worst of
one another, which makes for some pleasantly awesome scenarios. Although progression isn't a main
focus, it is sometimes brought to the foreground through; learning who a character once was or what they were like
and who they are now, or are becoming. Cowboy Bebop has a unique way of unfolding their awesome cast of characters.

Art Direction 8/10 Most modern day animes by comparison still don't do what Cowboy Bebop did in 1998!
Action scenes are crisp and fluid, colors are done in a nice gritty finnese for the most part. Artsy
moments ranging from vibrant with color, to the serene and subtle and moments with artistic pizazz!.

Music 10/10 If you're familiar with Yoko Kanno(the composer) you have already come to know her exceptional
quality. This soundtrack is truly outstanding. Contemporary jazz, up-beat techno, surreal musical compositions
truly every genre can be found here. For 26 episodes there is a WIDE array
of tracks to be heard, and even American tracks from some well-known artists! The music brings the art direction
and whole feel of cowboy bebop alive, overflowing with a truly genuine effort to combine with the anime and bring
it to its peak. Every song fits every moment it is cast into, without being forced.


Cowboy Bebop will capture the attention of almost any anime fan, whether they are looking for action, adventure, sci-fi, even some casual
slice of life elements. Each episode is written by a different individual, but there is an overall sense of
direction. Overall I give Cowboy Bebop a 8/10

Disclaimer: Some episodes can have a dramatically different feel, and I found some episodes to be personally slow.
Do not let this deter you from missing out on an overall great anime!

PS: If you found it helpful, or not helpful please, I implore you to contact me via message or comment!
I'm really looking for critique and want to hear from the anime fans themselves! Thankyou, so much ^_^

    Unlike some anime shows, this one does not grip you at the start, and some of the best/most interesting characters do not come in until a lot later.  The animation is slightly dated, and there are few special effects such as we are used to now.  The "futuristic" world shown is perhaps more reliant on spaceships, space travel, and successful colonization of neighbouring planets than is realistic.  However, despite these flaws, Cowboy Bebop remains an overall entertaining, engaging and, somewhat surprisingly, a moving show.

Great things about this show - the characters - they do have personality, annoyingly we never see the full

          
        depth of some of the characters, even by the end of the show there are still some mysteries that are never solved.  The people in the show give a good idea of the feeling and setting of the show, a series of run-down, rather sorry worlds after the almost ultimate demise of the first.  

The animation, as I said earlier, lacks special effects, particularly in the space-scenes, that we are accustomed to seeing in the 21st century, however the actual character designs are somewhat wacky and goofy at first - but ultimately, wonderful.  The unrealistically long legs and odd, long movements of the people in the show characterize its style, and somehow help to define the people in the show.  In particular the unrealistically wobbly arms of Ed (a character who arrives a little bit later) give us a good idea of his/her carefree, wacky, young, "wobbly" personality.

Some of the episodes, especially considering those nearer the end, feel a great deal like filler episodes, but almost every one is worth watching for the build-up to the last few, plus the film which came after this series and happens at some point "between" two of the episodes.  Most of the episodes in the beginning and middle give us little snippets of the characters' backgrounds and the plot which comes into play later on (most of the episodes are basically separate storylines).  

The music is also a highlight of the show, most of being composed by Yoko Kanno, famous for her diverse anime soundtracks.  Well, the variety and depth of music in Cowboy Bebop should not disappoint.  Some of it is country/folk music, fitting the Western theme of the series (COWBOY), but that which is not, is less expected and is fitting to whatever mood the show is trying to portray.

I thoroughly recommend Cowboy Bebop, even if, on the surface, it does not appear to be your sort of anime show.  The kind of anime I generally watch does not fall into many, if any, of Cowboy Bebop's categories (e.g Ao No Exorcist, Blood Lad, Persona 4: The Animation), but I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever after watching a show of this nature.  Trust me, even if it is not your sort of thing, you'll have to admit, even if after watching only one episode, that Cowboy Bebop has its merits.

    I was scared to touch this anime. Despite the reviews, despite my friend's sage advice, despite everything, I resisted for months. I didn't want to dive into something that showed only on Adult Swim at 2 in the morning on weekdays. It didn't seem like the kind of show I wanted to watch. I want to see the latest and greatest, the anime that grab the headlines, that are here and now, that are modern and are visually appealing. Cowboy Bebop didn't seem to me like it fit into any category I ever liked either. Western styled mixed with space drama? How can that even

          
        mix? Old style animation from the late 90s? Kinda makes me think of Hey Arnold and those other shows. It just didn't seem to fit the mood I currently reside in. And then I picked up the first episode. And I am a changed man. 

First, some background: it's a simple enough story. Spike and Jet, two oddities that somehow coexist inside the same spaceship, are partnered together in the pursuit of so-called bounties (fitting the western theme), and thus are called bounty hunters. Along the way in the beginning, they pick up some more companions to put the word "rag-tag" to shame: Faye Valentine, a debt-ridden woman who has forgotten her past, Ed (Edward), the pre-teen genius girl with computers, and Ein, the genetically enhanced and intelligent Corgi. The five travel the stars, attempting to gain bounties, but the results are....somewhat mixed.

Story: 9/10

I was skeptical. I truly was. I never liked western films, and I never cared for the themes and such of the Ol' Wild West. But the meld of science fiction with modern amenities really hit home. I could actually relate to the story, and oh what a story it was. Besides being such a motley bunch, they often were never agreeable and seemed to barely hold the peace in Jet's ship Bebop. But something about the way the story was told, how each character's mysterious past seemed to interfere with the present. Half of the series wasn't really fighting for bounties, but trying to bury or avoid their individual past without notifying or effecting the other persons aboard the ship, to no avail. It was interesting, then, when the past comes back to haunt you: nothing is as it seems on the surface, and when the past scratches at its coffin, you better be there with a nail or sig-sauer. 

Art: 10/10

I must say, at first it was hard to....understand and perceive the old-style animation. This made me want to turn it off and watch the anime of today. But you got used to it real quick. And I must say, for something almost two decades old, it's gorgeous. The lighting, the style, the drawings, the shades, the colors, the environment...It was hard not to notice the variety of places the art alluded to, and of course the western touch with the deserts and saloons and gunfights and such. I loved every bit of it, and remember, I hate the west. The spaceships juxtaposed next to the average car and the old-fashioned lighters lighting old-fashioned cigarettes created this interesting mood and ambiance, one I hadn't felt....ever. It was surreal.

Sound: 9.5/10

Alright, before you blast me with why it isn't perfect, it wasn't. But it was damn near perfect. Jazz? Blues? Fast-paced music? Are those ENGLISH lyrics? Yes they all are here, for you, the watcher, to enjoy. Every major scene had a fast-paced song, and many a time it was in English. The producers and editors and such probably drew much of their inspiration from the American West, and it showed well in the sound. The OP was fast-paced and well executed, and the ED was nostalgic sounding and epic. But I didn't get too focused on the petty ending and beginning; it was the background music I'm talking about. Beautiful, beautiful salute to the American west and native American music. I couldn't get enough, especially when the main characters are so motley, the odd choice of music just made the mood that much better. And why stop there? The voice actors should be praised, no given medals, their acting was so good. It wasn't even the way each character spoke, but when each character decided to show his or her true nature to the viewer before quickly covering it up; beautiful just beautiful. 

Character: 10/10

Oh how I would rate this higher if I could. I've never had such deep characters before, such amazingly portrayed people. Pretend each character is a book: Spike would be a carefree one, its leather new, its polish gleaming. Jet would be gruff and rough on the edges, worn from time. Faye's would be delicate, with an evil-looking cover that betrays evil, and so on. But as you delve deeper in the story and therefore each character's secret past, the books become much different: Spike's becomes worn and rough, like Jet's, frayed on the outside, with a hole punched straight through the middle. Jet's would be more worn, yet have a soft spot in the middle. Faye's would have a huge question mark from chapter 1 to somewhere around the middle, then soften into a golden hue. Seems stupid, but I ain't spoiling anything. But honestly, each of these characters deserves his or her own biography; each story, so different from each other, yet they all come back to haunt them in the present. And as each character deals with their ghosts, they must make a tough decision: to let the ghost keep haunting them, or to finally put it all to rest? If you don't like extended analogies, then go watch Cowboy Bebop and skip my review. Time's a wastin'. 

When I think of Cowboy Bebop, I don't think of old, garish, rubbish pictures of grainy animation and slipshod storylines made to fit the mass audience it tries and fails to appeal to. What I see now is a masterpiece that will last the ages - and I should have known better if an anime gets a English adaptation and is shown in America for over a decade it should be pretty freaking good. And I finally digress; if I am not able to convince you to watch the show by now, I have failed as a reviewer because, if anything, this was the best show I've ever watched. I can't say that for anything else, because I'm one of those people that says everything is his favorite show. But this easily trumps all that. See you later, Space Cowboy.

    "Well heres another great moment in the legend of Spike, famous bounty hunter and dog walker."
-Spike Spiegel

Due to my increasingly robust backlog I rarely take the opportunity to rewatch an anime. For the sake of Cowboy Bebop, one of my few critically acclaimed series, I decided to make an exception. My re-analysis was sparked by a conversation I had recently with a friend, in which she asked me what I loved so much about the series. For some reason, I couldn't rattle off a list or even a few distinct reasons as to why I hold the series in such high regard. This led me

          
        to grow curious of my thoughts if I gave it a re-watch. This was my gateway anime, the series that truly drew me to the medium in the first place, and I find it only fair to remove the nostalgia goggles for a bit and give this series a second look. Did it stand the test of time? Is it still a 10 out of 10? Well, there's only one way to find out. I'm reviewing this from a purely critical standpoint so it may get rather lengthy. Minor spoilers ahead.

Although it debuted in the late 90s, I was first introduced to Bebop about a decade ago, the summer of my junior year in high school (I realize I just dated myself). Up until that time I had always looked at anime as gimmicky or childish, cartoons lacking intellectual plot lines and flooded with girls sporting cat ears, with ultraviolent shock factor. When I had discovered Adult Swim on Cartoon Network, I was ecstatic. I would willingly stay up into the wee hours of the morning powering through shows like Bebop, Outlaw Star and Samurai Champloo, expanding my anime resume and loving every second of it. I think specifically in Bebop's case, the anime is subconsciously praised more for what it accomplished rather than its content. It helped spark a western anime revolution with entertainment fans in Europe and North America, creating a series approved by both avid anime connoisseurs and casual viewers. Not only did Bebop succeed, but it did so without tasteless fan service, harems, bad English voice acting or most anything else Americans commonly complain about in anime. In retrospect, I am so grateful to this series for opening my eyes to the medium and showing me how enjoyable anime can truly be.

When it comes to plot content, Cowboy Bebop is actually kind of bare-bones. The over-arcing storyline serves more as a backdrop then a focal point of the series. Spike Spiegel, a lethargic space bounty hunter stricken by the grief of losing his lover collects rewards from nabbing various criminals around the galaxy. His partner, Jet Black acts as the perfect balance in personality to Spike, exuding wisdom as well as common sense. They encounter a seemingly insurmountable amount of bad luck, pick up more crewmembers and come to terms with the ghosts of their past. Those ghosts are perhaps stronger for no one other than Spike, who has thoughts of his mistresse's killer looming in the back of his mind, waiting for a final battle with a one time friend spanning the length of the galaxy. Spike even sports a fake eye, a testament to his imperfection.

Throughout Spike and Jet's escapades in space, Cowboy Bebop explores a plethora of themes including loss, existentialism and loneliness. Each episode ebbs and flows with distinct tonal shifts accompanied by peppy jazz medleys along the way. The editing is quite fluid. I've always enjoyed the way this era of anime (Serial Experiments Lain, Visions of Escaflowne etc.) would create points of pondering or intellectual thought and didn't just slam the subject matter in your face. Although the anime is episodic in nature, this almost works to its advantage, adding snippets of various symbolism in its environment and dialogue. Even more cheeky episodes like the one where the crew discovers psychedelic mushrooms, help to illustrate the boredom one must face in the life of space. There are even moments where characters seem to be intoxicated or having some sort of transcendental experience, crafted almost entirely by the mind's ability to meander basically anywhere. Viewers have the unique ability to witness these themes vicariously through the crew and sympathize with them accordingly. This is definitely a quality of the anime I didn't appreciate the first time I watched it, but now that I'm older I do.

Another portion that works towards Cowboy Bebop's advantage is the lack of internal monologue with the characters. Instead of overtly telling the viewer what each character is thinking, the writers leave the inferring to our own minds. It's what some critics like to call the "intelligence test" with movies and TV alike. Sometimes monologues can detract from a series if not done properly or too often by taking the viewer out of an analytic role. Similar to this is how the entire environment is constructed. Everything feels very matter-of-fact, much like you're just dropping in as a fly on the wall with little or no introduction to the setting. The narrative is never ruined by a character abruptly stopping to explain something, which would be entirely unnecessary based on how well everything is illustrated in Cowboy Bebop. It gives you a warm fuzzy for how real life in futuristic space would be like. Even as the show concluded, with the lead character's fate being in question, there was no long drawnout speech, just the ending scenes for the viewers to decide the overall outcome. Bebop ends up being that show that can either be watched all at once or at a 1 to 2 episode a night speed. It's perfect to enjoy after a long day at school or work or just wanting to relax and enjoy some good quality entertainment.

In a perfect world an anime would balance intellectual and story driven elements with finesse. Unfortunately, this is one area that Cowboy Bebop suffers. If you don't appreciate the characters or get interested in the symbolism side of things, there isn't much else left to keep the anime afloat. Lucky for me I was able to appreciate the references and themes more this time around, so it didn't putter out or feel boring to me. There were instances where I became distracted, which were annoying, causing me to skip back and there aren't a lot of times where I was glued to my seat with excitement. It's one of those shows where you have to sit back and just take it all in, which isn't necessarily for everyone. The episodic approach offers multiple vignettes where a story is built up and concluded, all in 20 minutes.  This is a difficult task to tackle, which often lead to creating many one-dimensional villains and making me feel quite unattached from their cause, whatever it may have been. The ending also appeared to be more of a plot convenience than a justifiable conclusion.  It's almost as though Shinichiro Watanabe (director) ran out of storyboard and decided to put into place a rather cliche' ending on the series. These negatives stand out like a scratch on a new car, as they prevent the series from truly being a masterpiece. Most people would be apt to forget about these points however, since the general consensus is that Bebop is the pinnacle of Japanese animation.

The characters and Cowboy Bebop are undoubtedly one of the stronger points of the series. Watanabe did a great job of portraying the characters as relative opposites, in both demeanor and appearance. Spike is clean-cut with a dry personality, while Jet is patriarchal and political with a more rugged attire. Apparently Watanabe originally designed Spike to wear an eye patch, but the producers wrote it off early in development. Honestly, Jet serves as the entire parental unit a board the crew's ship. He's responsible, he cooks and is in charge of overseeing all the major repairs the ship undergoes. Faye, described by her Japanese voice actor as an "ugly" woman, does a fantastic job causing trouble and avoiding basically any responsibility for it. However, her enigmatic past makes her rather redeemable as a character and leaves a large area open for interpretation. There really isn't a heavily endowed, brain dead dame in Bebop. Speaking of enigmatic, the androgynous Ed has some mysteries of his own... or should I say "her" own. Dopey and unpredictable are just a few words to describe the hacker. Apparently, Ed's personality was crafted based on Yoko Kanno, the notorious composer of Bebop's OST. She must have been one interesting woman. Oddly enough, Watanabe originally proposed Ed as a male, but was gender swapped to even out the sausage fest. And let's not forget the most adorable anime pet in existence, Ein... the laziest/cutest data dog in the galaxy. Each of the characters exhibit some robust skeletons from their past and experience obvious signs of boredom and abandonment along the way. Spike's intriguing involvement with his rival Vicious is fueled by rage and revenge, two qualities not normally promulgated in Spike's personality. At the same time, It's a relationship I feel could've been expanded upon a little more. There are too many anime that falter when giving proper depth to antagonists, and Cowboy Bebop succumbs to the same issue.

If you hadn't already realized, the music is vital to Cowboy Bebop's storytelling and scene progression. Jazzy, upbeat tunes are juxtaposed with hand to hand combat and perilous situations, but everything seemed to click. Yoko Kanno had worked wonders with Sunrise Animations, and Bebop is quite possibly her magnum opus. It's one of the few anime soundtracks I could listen to standalone, without people questioning what the hell I was listening to.  It truly sounds like tracks out of a movie. Both the English and Japanese voice acting is impeccable, with props given to our lord and savior, Stephen Blum for his portrayal of Spike and Melissa Fahn as Edward. The OP is iconic, with superb, James Bond-like animation and the ED never really aged poorly for me. Overall, many present day anime could learn a thing or two about Bebop's music and how important it is to the series.  Without the soundtrack, this anime would "ok" at best. Animation has already been covered briefly, but I reiterate how well the artists created such a vivid depiction of space and the future. The character models were all very unique and their faces were emblazoned with personality.

Although I still very much appreciate this anime, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around. Maybe it was half out of expectation or previous involvement, but something didn't feel as interesting to me. Still, I would urge just about any anime fan to check out the series if not already done. If for no other reason than to experience how great this time period was for anime in general, and how it paved the way for the growing industry. Like I previously stated, most people my age hold the series in such high regard due to pure nostalgia or how it opened their eyes to the medium of anime, I know it did for me. It's a series you can sit down and talk about even with non-anime fans, and believe me that's hard to find. I would prefer the series not be remade, as Watanabe suggests, but would be interested in a western, live-action adaptation. I think a successful American release of Ghost In The Shell will open the flood gates for future adaptations. As always, thanks for reading the review and be sure to check out my other works!

The second, titled Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, is a retelling of the anime, done by Cain Kuga, and also ran in Asuka Fantasy DX during 1997.  Both have been licensed Stateside by Tokyopop, and the release date for the third and second and final volumes for both were

          
        August 20th, 2002, and June 10th, 2003.

The anime itself ran for twenty-six episodes, though it originally had a disrupted run on TV Tokyo from April 3rd to June 19th, 1998, before airing in full on a disrupted broadcast schedule on the satellite network WOWOW from October 23rd, 1998 to April 23rd, 1999.  It was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on Inuyasha and the Gundam series), and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (famous for his work on Macross Plus and Samurai Champloo).  It was licensed Stateside by Bandai Entertainment, and the box set of the Remix episodes (which was also the version I watched) was released on February 5th of this year (2008).  There is a movie that was released not long after the series ended, which I will cover later in the review.

Story: It's the year 2071 AD, and mankind has colonized the entire solar system.  Spike Spiegel is a Cowboy (this era's term for bounty hunters) who works with Jet Black to track down bounties and struggle to live off of them.  Along the way, they pick up a few extra people and their pasts are bought to light.

Cowboy Bebop is, for the most part, a bounty of the week episode, with some minor continuing threads.  All in all, it's done pretty well, with bounties delving into the pasts of characters, and being just interesting in general.  The characters are an interesting bunch of people, with Ed taking the cake as crack in human form.  :P  

Some will complain that the plot in the last two episodes comes out of nowhere, but they're a bit inaccurate there; the threads have been building up in episodes here and there throughout the show, though they are admittedly a bit scattered.

Art: The show's a bit dated, obviously.  But, compared to other shows that were airing around that time (Ruroni Kenshin, Beserk), the animation is pretty good.  The designs for characters are very well done, and the designs for the ships and all the backgrounds in particular are amazingly detailed.

Music: Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts did the work for this soundtrack, and it's absolutely amazing.  There's so much variety in all the variations on jazz and blues that they do for this, and it's amazingly catchy.  This was one of the first soundtracks I actively noticed in a show and tried to find.  

They also did work on the OP, &quot;Tank!&quot; (which Baccano! takes a cue from) and ED, &quot;The Real Folk Blues&quot;, both of which are instantly memorable and fit the series quite well.

Length: I liked sixteen out of the twenty-six total episodes, and the series probably would've done well to keep those episodes in the long run and cut the rest.  Still, all in all, that's a pretty good percentage.

Seiyuu: Megumi Hayashibara (famous for her roles as Rei Ayanami in Evangelion and Atsuko Chiba and Paprika in Paprika) plays Faye Valentine in this, and Jouji Nakata appears in a minor role.  I admire Ed's seiyuu for being able to capture the sheer crazy of her character.  All in all, a pretty good job.

Voice Actors: Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I watched, back when it was regularly airing on Adult Swim.  When I went back to watch it, I found that, all things considered, the voice actors did a pretty good job with their roles.  The voices weren't quite the same, but, all in all, still fit the characters pretty well.  One of the better dubs I've seen out there.

Dub: Looking back on the dub, it was one of the better dubs I saw back when I was first getting into anime.  A few lines of dialogue were altered in the English version, and some minor edits were made so that it was able to air on TV, but compared to DiC's butchering of Sailor Moon, it was a pretty good job.  If only they could've all been this good.


Overall: A well-done show, with an episodic plot that delves into it's character's past that sporadically builds to the conclusion, detailed animation, amazing music, and a pretty good dub.  

Definitely in my top ten shows; a must-watch.

    I have been putting Cowboy Bebop off for a month or two, watching an episode here, watching an episode there, dropping it, putting it on hold, picking it back up again, etc. It's a little hard to get into considering it is solely character driven from the first episode on, and since you don't even find out...anything...about the characters until the tenth or so episode, there isn't much to work off of in the "do I or don't I" character like/attachment department. 

Story-wise, Cowboy Bebop doesn't actually have any past 4, maybe 5, episodes overall. It is episodic, some of the 20 minute plotlines a

          
        hit, and others a miss. Some are character-based, some are silly (the fridge will get cleaned out more often now if I have anything to say about it), and some are serious. Once you finally hit the actual "story" of Cowboy Bebop near the end, it is amazing how well they managed to set it up and run it so smoothly without much priorly given information. 

It took me until the last day I decided to just sit down and watch the last seven episodes to decide if I just meh liked, or loved, the characters. I've settled into a happy medium. Everyone down to Ein have a sort of apathetic depth that makes them feel all the more real. They have flaws, they have personalities, they work well together. Sometimes it's hard to remember they are fictional because of how naturally they act. 

Overall, Cwboy Bebop delivers enjoyment of  not being a "this is what we learned today" anime, but also not a shallow, "who cares" anime. It has a level of depth where it gives off a "this is what's going on and we don't care if you have an issue with it" feel, something that made it boring, or extra good, depending on my mood. It's a good one to try and see, and it's also a good one to watch over a period of time, and give a couple of chances. It definitely has a bit of everything, from silly to downright creepy, and even if you don't like it as a whole, you will probably find at least one episode that suits your tastes.

    I'm not one to jump on the hype train. I try to not get high hopes for anything, because usually you are going to be let down. I've heard the praise for this show so many times over the years. Google "Top Ten Anime Series" and almost every list will have Bebop in it, usually at #1. So I went in hesitantly, and I've gotta tell you...

Cowboy Bebop is a goddamn masterpiece.

Each episode is usually standalone. That right there tends to steer a lot of would-be viewers away from this series. Even I was a bit hesitant to plunge into a show with an episodic

          
        structure. But I'll tell you, this show really pulls it off. There are a few episodes that connect together, but for the most part, it's a standalone affair.

The series follows the bounty hunting crew of the good ship Bebop in the year 2071. It depicts their daily lives as bounty hunters, as well as giving us insight into their pasts. Most episodes or "sessions" as they are called, tend to focus on the crew attempting to secure a bounty. This might sound a tad bit repetitive, but I swear it's not. The sheer unpredictability and creativity that is put into each session assures the audience that things will never get boring.

The strength of the show really isn't in its plot, though. It's the characters that drive the series forward. They are all incredibly well developed, which is an amazing feat due to the episodic nature of the show. Each of the four principle characters are completely different, and they all feel real and authentic. 

Them all being squeezed into one ship creates a brilliant stew of character interaction. Their ideals and viewpoints clash on the regular, which creates some interesting scenes. They also bond over time, even though some of the characters try their best to hide it. 

Their pasts are also heavily explored, as one of the recurring themes throughout the show is that your past will always catch up with you. This applies more to the central character, Spike Spiegel, more than the rest however. Each member of the main cast gets a few episodes specifically focusing on them, adopting a flashback format. These are generally the best episodes of the show, in my opinion.

I fell in love with these characters, and it was heartbreaking to see them go through so many ordeals. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Ed won't leave your mind for a long time after you finish the show.

The art and animation are incredibly good for its time. There are some series now that fail to reach Bebop's level of artistic beauty and fluid animation. For example, Trigun, which came out around the same time, is nothing compared to Sunrise's work on Bebop. The art isn't too flashy, but it perfectly creates a realistic space western feel. You feel like this world has been lived in, and things aren't always pretty. The character designs in particular are impressive, as each member of the cast has a different and recognizable look. 

The animation is flawless. Absolutely flawless. This is expertly conveyed in the action scenes, which have a naturalistic and fluid feel to them that is rarely achieved in anime. The only flaw on the art and animation fronts is the computer generated graphics that are used several times during the show. They look out of place and don't really meld well with the environments, but hey, the show came out in 1998! I think I can cut it some slack. Still worth mentioning though.

The soundtrack is where this show excels at a level I don't think I've ever heard before. The mix of jazz and blues, with a little bit of classic rock thrown in brings the show to life. It fits the mood of the show perfectly, even though it might sound odd for a science fiction show. It works, though, I swear it. As a testament to its greatness, I'm listening to the soundtrack right now, as I write this review. Props to Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, for real. I mean, "Space Lion" is one of the greatest tracks I've ever heard.

The English dubbing of this show is in a class of its own. It fits the show perfectly, with each cast member giving it their all. I don't know how good the Japanese audio track is, but it's going to be hard to beat this. It's fucking unbelievable. I mean, Steve Blum kills it.

This show is considered a classic today. I had heard all the praise. Not once did I buy it. I went into this show thinking that it probably wasn't going to live up to its praise. I was wrong. Dead wrong. 

The sophistication of it's themes and characters are unrivaled in anime. The beautiful art and stunning animation. The wonderful soundtrack. The great ending. Oh yes, the ending. It's a stunning conclusion that managed to wow me and break my heart at the same time. This is animation at its finest. 

For reference, here are my top five favorite episodes:

5. Waltz for Venus/Pierrot Le Fou 
4. Hard Luck Woman
3. Ballad of Fallen Angels
2. Jupiter Jazz (Parts I & II)
1. The Real Folk Blues (Parts I & II)

See you, space cowboy.

    Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to criticize. Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical classic armor, which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact groundbreaking, but

          
        I think a work needs more than superficial qualities to be truly revolutionary or great.


Cowboy bebop borrows much from western media and pop culture in general. his show pays homage to or references, subtly and overtly, things as disparate as Antonio Banderas, Bruce Lee, John Woo, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Convoy, Biggie Smalls, Donald Duck, various mythologies and folktales, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Bill Evans, Stray Cats, Alien, blaxploitation films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Queen, George Clooney, Led Zeppelin, Django and other spaghetti westerns, Herbie Hancock, American and Japanese professional baseball, Yellow Magic Orchestra, Jean-Luc Godard, Batman,  B.B. King, Beverly Hills 90210, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, The Unabomber, Heaven's Gate and Marshall Applewhite, Kiss, film noir, The Beatles, Sleeping Beauty, Bonny & Clyde, Ziggy Stardust, Charlie Parker, Woody Allen, Star Trek, Cool Hand Luke, and Taxi Driver. I kid you not. And that's not a complete list. References in character design and dialogue are forgivable, but when it straight up copies scenes and plots then I think it can be held against the show. I feel like I've seen Cowboy Bebop before, it's just been packed into a pretty package. I enjoyed a lot of these homages, but that does not excuse the marked lack of creativity. The mere evocation of a masterpiece does not make a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is an example of someone who uses pastiche and cultural references well, and most importantly, his references and homages don't make up his entire videography. There is far too little originality in Cowboy Bebop. 


The fact is that Cowboy Bebop is the epitome of style over substance. I can appreciate it for its audiovisuals, but, to me, a show needs more than that to be a true masterpiece. Make no mistake though, it does have some of the best audiovisuals I've ever seen, and could arguably be considered a must-watch for that alone. The OST is good (despite also being a tad overrated,) the art is great, and the animation is extremely fluid. It should also be noted that Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime that holds the distinction of having an English dub superior to the original Japanese. The atmosphere that the audiovisuals achieve is their greatest quality, and is distinct in almost every different setting. This is not done well in most space travel anime, and I have to applaud Cowboy Bebop for that achievement at least. 


The main storyline consists of about 5 episodes, the rest of them being episodic individual stories. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but the episodic stories were hit or miss, and they never measured up to the main plot. Some of the non-main episodes focus on a character and their past, and this is good, but most of them are completely pointless and could be removed without anybody noticing. One of them was about fighting an alien-fungus-fridge-monster, it was an interesting and silly parody of Alien, but it contributed nothing to plot or character development. Considering how character driven this show is, that's a problem. There was also an entire episode paying homage to blaxploitation. Seeing as the allusion was presented in a more original way, and the episode showed a lot about Ed's character, that one was not only forgivable, but it was one of my favorite episodes. Like I said, hit or miss. There is an episode about catching a super-dog. There is an episode about a virus that turns people into monkeys. There is an episode where they chase a bomber (Woody Allen) with some help from a transsexual looking trucker. At least 4 episodes were easily 10s, but more of them were closer to 5s. The first 4 episodes were particularly weak, which is a huge problem in a 2 cour anime. The anime may have had a good conclusion, but the sub-par exposition cannot be ignored. 


The main crew was made up of interesting and entertaining characters, and they prevented the episodic nature of the show from being a complete flop, although there were some unanswered questions about Faye's past in particular. Actually, strangely enough, the unanswered questions contributed to the splendid atmosphere. Everything had a rich backstory, but few flashbacks and no infodumps. This helped give the show its characteristic nostalgic atmosphere. One complaint I would have is that the main antagonist is simply not compelling, his motivations are somewhat unclear, and he's just one dimensional. He also uses a katana, even though its the future, and somehow still manages to kick ass. Hes just very clich and lame. The antagonist in the movie was very well done with his depth, motives, and parallels to Spike, and that makes me wish Vicious got the same treatment, as it would fit his character far better, and his character is far more important. 


One thing you should understand is that the characters are often good examples of clichs done well. Jet, for instance, is the typical hard-boiled former cop, but he is also the most empathetic of the crew. He is a foil to Spike and is hard working, but they also parallel in many ways. Ed is the teen genius/tomboy and hacker with little depth, but she also serves as a foil to Spike and many of his views on life. Faye is like a mix of all of the other characters' worst traits in terms of personality, but she still manages to be a sympathetic character. In fact, even though she keeps up her unpleasant exterior and despite her being the anime's main source of fanservice, she arguably experiences more development than any other character. Still, they lack any sort of real innovation, in anime or otherwise.


Despite all my criticisms, Cowboy Bebop is cool. It's very cool. The characters and aesthetics were compelling (for the most part) to the point where I even enjoyed some of the admittedly weaker episodes. I can't give it a 10, it's simply not a masterpiece. I can't give it a 9, it's not truly great. I can't give it an 8, it's too flawed and unoriginal. I dont want to give it a 7, it was just too inconsistent. I have to settle on a 6.7 or so, which could be rounded either way. That said, an average of my story, art, sound, and character scores did give me around a 7.2. 


Cowboy Bebop is enjoyable and it has wide appeal; I would probably recommend it to just about anybody. It was up and down in terms of quality, and it was similar to a slice-of-life in its episodic and relaxed nature and its lack of an explosive climax, but it was good. I liked how the anime takes place after the "important part" of the main characters' lives is over, and nostalgia becomes a huge theme, seeing as it was the first anime I ever watched and it thus evokes a huge sense of nostalgia for me anyway. I loved the laid back atmosphere. The problem is that after looking through all of the episodes and rating them individually, I realized that the majority of it was nothing special. With a little restraint and reworking, Cowboy Bebop could have been the masterpiece that it is widely regarded as, and it does hold a special place in my heart regardless, even if that is only due to it being my first anime. That bias is probably why I choose to round the score to 7, rather than to 6, despite the fact that the latter is typically the better practice. 


I am always willing to defend and justify my scores so leave me a comment if you disagree, and tell me why Im wrong. I say that because this does seem to be a pretty uncommon score, even among those whose opinions I have great respect for. Keep in mind that a 7 is a generous and good score in any case.

    I had the chance to watch Cowboy Bebop before. Why didnt I watch it?

After watching Cowboy Bebop, it was as if I went through an otaku ritual. I believe that every otaku out there should watch Cowboy Bebop  at least once in their lives  and realize how anime should be done.

The story-telling, the dialogue, the feel, the emotions. Everything was just mixed right. Every episode was unique and almost perfect. Every episode started and ended in a way you didnt expect. My personal favorite, was Session 20, Pierrot le Fou. That episode sent chills down my spine. I wont tell why, just so

          
        anyone who reads this review would feel obligated to watch Cowboy Bebop in its entirety. Session 23 was not bad either; I love the intellectual conversations about who God is throughout the episode.

The characters made this anime. I loved every single one of them (including the supporting characters) and their individual quirks. My favorite was Spike Spiegel, of course. I love it whenever he did jeet kune do, the martial arts system that was developed by Bruce Lee. It was just exciting to watch him fight. Jet Black was just as cool as Spike. I am fascinated at his bounty hunter skills, as well as his past. Any man with a past is automatically cool. I didnt like Faye Valentine at first, mostly because of her voice, but after you get to know more about her (the anime will reveal her past), youll realize that shes one strong woman. Finally, theres Ed. She (Its not a typo) is one wacky kid and surprisingly adorable.

The voice acting really contributed to the characters personalities. Spike, without Kouichi Yamaderas voice, would never be as cool as he is with him. Jets past would almost seep through Unshou Ishizukas voice. I already said that Fayes voice, more specifically Megumi Hayashibaras voice irritated me in the beginning, but she really brought out Fayes personality. Aoi Tadas voice made Ed even cuter. I also have to note that the banter and random discourse between these four are absolutely entertaining.

Shinichiro Watanabe played a huge role in making Cowboy Bebop visually appealing. Watching the series was just so easy on the eyes  the scenes werent heavy or overloaded at all. The scenes went on smoothly, and each scene was lovely to look at. The colors were great, and the backgrounds were detailed enough. However, I did not like the 3D animation all too much cause I found it a bit too rough, but considering it was made in 1998, I guess it wasnt that bad.

Yoko Kanno was another factor that made me love this anime so much. She is one musical genius, and I love her work on Cowboy Bebop. I think there were new tracks for every episode, and each one complimented the scenes beautifully. Each one was different too  Tank! And The Real Folk Blues were jazzy and bluesy, but there were pop, classic, whatever tracks throughout the series too. While Shinichiro Watanabe was telling a story through sight, Yoko Kanno was doing the same through sound.

Truth be told, I wasnt enthusiastic in watching Cowboy Bebop in the beginning. Thats because Im not really into sci-fi themes, but Cowboy Bebop was different. The thing I like about it the most is that its charisma transcends through time. In three words, its a classic.

    Overview:

Today I will look at what is probably the most universally well received anime by non-otaku and casual viewers. It is well known that "film snobs" don't have the same taste as average film goers. A film snob will say Citizen Kane or Tokyo Story is the best movie of all time whereas an average viewer will generally choose something like The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption. With anime it is the same way. If Legend of the Galactic Heroes is the Citizen Kane of anime revered by all the elitist snobs, and all those people making a pathetic attempt to "prove" that they are

          
        intellectuals, than Cowboy Bebop is The Godfather of anime. It is THE anime of the common man.

Story: 8/10

Cowboy Bebop is largely episodic and many episodes stand alone, but it does have an overall plot that moves forward. The story takes place in a future where warp gates have made rapid travel between the planets easy and most of the solar system has been terraformed and colonized. However, a hypergate above Earth exploded and badly damaged the moon. This caused large chunks of moon to bombard Earth and devastate much of the human population, so few humans remain on our original home world. Our main protagonist is a bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel (extremely Jewish last name) who is visually modeled on the body of Lupin the 3rd with Bob Dylan's hair and face. You know, because Shinichi Watanabe is an insane person. Spike's partner is an ex-cop and jazz enthusiast named Jet Black, who is a white man obviously voiced by a black man. You know...because Watanabe is an insane person. On their many adventures they meet a Taiwanese scam artist who claims to be a Gypsy, a genetically modified Welsh Corgi, and an androgenous, genius computer hacker. The crew of the Bebop will take on any job no matter how dangerous, but something always seems to go wrong and they never get paid very much for all their efforts. We also find out that Spike once worked for a major crime syndicate and has a tragic past love with a woman named Julia and unfinished business with a vicious mobster simply named...Vicious.

Characters: 10/10

Cowboy Bebop has an absolutely amazing cast of characters. Spike is one of the most beloved protagonists in all of anime. He is a master bounty hunter and the baddest Jew in space! Jet's humor is a bit more dry than other characters like Edward, but now that I'm older I find myself liking Jet quite a bit. Faye is a voluptuous femme fatale that is quite amusing throughout the series with her schemes and antics, and Ed is...just Ed. With the red hair, gender ambiguity, obvious Asperger's, and being the world's greatest computer hacker and Chess Player, Ed shares a surprising number of traits with Lisbeth Salender of the Millenium Trilogy. Maybe Ed gave birth to Lisbeth after an affair with the short tempered and perpetually snarky Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho? That would pretty much explain Lisbeth to a T. Anyways, the last character is the deliciously over the top villain simply known as Vicious. He wears a trench coat over a black military uniform, fights with a katana against opponents with guns, and always has an evil raven perched on his shoulder. What a fucking badass! When Vicious isn't carving motherfuckers up with his katana, he is smiling psychotically and scheming some devious master plan to screw yet another person over. Gotta love Vicious.

Sound: 10/10

This is by far the best Jazz soundtrack in all of anime, and perhaps the best soundtrack period. I personally like the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X soundtrack, but Cowboy Bebop is easily my #2. Even if you think you don't like Jazz, you will love this soundtrack. It's virtually impossible not to.

Art: 8/10

The art is somewhat dated since this show was made in the 1990s, but still holds up pretty well. It is animated a LOT less lazily than DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, and most other 90s anime. The character designs are interestingly enough largely based on Lupin the 3rd with Spike being given Lupin's lanky body, Jet has Jigen's beard, and Vicious has Goemon's hair and face. This was a fun and clever homage by the animators to a 1970s classic.

Enjoyment: 10/10

I rated it a 10 because it won't let me pull a Spinal Tap and give it that extra little oomph up to 11! This series has plane dogfights, epic shootout scenes, fist fights, swordplay, and any kind of action you can think of. The series also homages many classic movies and genres depending on what planet the crew visits. Hell, there is even a blaxploitation film tribute episode!

Overall: 10/10

Cowboy Bebop is not my personal #1 anime of all time, but it is definitely in my top 10. Even though there are series that are closer to my heart on a personal level, Bebop is probably the most flawless anime I have ever seen. There is literally nothing to hate about this series. The art, storytelling, characters, music, and direction are all so well done that I can't imagine anyone saying that this sucks! I am emotionally attached to a few series above Bebop, but I recognize that those series have some flaws and see why others might mock and ridicule them. To use a baseball analogy, Cowboy Bebop doesn't quite swing for the fences in that same way where it will either be a grand slam or a strike out. Bebop is that perfect line drive that may not knock it out of the park for you, but it will definitely connect and be a respectable hit! If you are new to anime or if you are under the age of 20 and have simply never seen this slightly older series, you should check it out!

    "And the work which has become a genre unto itself shall be called: Cowboy Bebop" 

^ This sentence was showed several times during the episodes and it is already giving away about the uniqueness Cowboy Bebop carries. There are many unique anime in our anime world, but most of them fail to execute it well. However, fortunately that is not the case with Cowboy Bebop. It is a truly classic anime with incredibly awesome soundtrack and brilliant character development.

Cowboy Bebop centers around a group of bounty hunters in a futuristic, space-western setting. The year is 2071 and the place is our Solar System, where various

          
        planets and moons have been terraformed for human settlement. Bebop is a spaceship where two bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are travelling around the space and hunting down their preys to earn money. Along the way their duo (2) becomes a quintet (5) when the engineered dog Ein, beautiful yet very complicated women Faye Valentine, and computer genius teenage girl Edward (yes a girl) joins their group, or I should say forced themselves in.

This newly formed bounty hunter group is ridiculously unlucky since the day their duo became a quintet. However, this is exactly what brings the comedy. Their unlucky hunt probably is due to the lack of teamwork and recognition of each other skills. Even though they are all highly skilled in certain areas, they all usually go alone on the job which is what makes the series even more entertaining.

Yes, the plot is not the main engine of Cowboy Bebop series. Every episode is a new story and rarely has any relevance to the past episodes. Sometimes they are dramatic, sometimes comedic and sometimes very serious. When the episode starts, you simply have no clue what theme and mood this time it will be and will they capture their prey or not, or maybe it will be one of those rare episodes when they follow the main story of Cowboy Bebop? In any case, all episodes are very enjoyable and unpredictable.

Since the plot is not the main engine, then what exactly makes Cowboy Bebop series so amazing that it is usually listed in most anime top lists? Well that probably is characters and OST. Every one of the main character's have some really harsh past that they do not want to share with anyone at all. It is something they treasure a lot. All of this does not stop them from some really amusing interaction.

As I mentioned already, they have some really harsh pasts. This "past" thing is what gives a lot of room for the character development. Their past is not revealed in one short episode and what is most important - the way their past is revealed. Usually past is revealed by jumping into flashbacks, however that is not the case with Cowbow Bebop. To see how it is done, you will have to watch it yourself, but I can reassure you that their growth as individual and as a team member is definitely executed extremely well and in entertaining way.

Music is the other major factor why this series is so brilliant. Whole soundtrack is simply superb. This whole jazz music is fitting the story perfectly. I have never seen another anime that could go so perfectly in sync with its soundtrack. The last two episodes is kinda a showdown of the beauty that jazz can actually offer in combination with great story.

What is really surprising that animation is rather good considering in what year Cowboy Bebop aired. Usually I am very picky on the old anime because I cannot withstand crappy animation and just because of this I avoided Cowboy Bebop too. Well now I can certainly say that either the series were so entertaining that I did not notice animation flaws or the animation was just simply good enough considering it was released in 1998.

Overall, Cowboy Bebop is in the anime top tier list definitely for a reason. With its great amusing characters, beautiful and very fitting jazz music it also gives many short yet brilliant stories. I am not afraid to use this word to describe Cowboy Bebop at all - MASTERPIECE.

P.S. I must praise the voice actors who dubbed it amazingly well. I do not know how was the Japanese dubs, but English were great.

    Introduction:
On October 24th, 1998, Cowboy Bebop started its first full airing in Japan, it ended the next year on April 24th. It was later broadcasted in the United States as the first anime to ever appear on Adult Swim, and it still is broadcasted on a loop to this day. Now, as many of you probably know Cowboy Bebop is definitely a very popular anime, and it's no wonder it's still broadcasting today, even after most anime have left Adult Swim. Why is so popular though? Well the answer is simple, Cowboy Bebop is a very finely crafted, almost perfect creation that deserves every bit

          
        of popularity it gets. With that said, let's get started with the review.

Actual Review:
Let's start with a plot summary, Cowboy Bebop, follows a group of bounty hunters in the distant future who have various missions and members focused on each episode. There's Spike Spiegel, a cool and rowdy man who can fight very well, with a mysterious past to boot. Next, there's Jet, the founder of the Bebop crew and a former ISSP Officer, or a police officer if you prefer, with a missing arm and is the intelligence of the group. Then we have the lovely lady, Fei Valentine, a gambling, trouble making woman who has a mysterious problem. Lastly there's Edward, she's the crazy hacker from Earth who is the comic relief for a lot of the show, we will get to how that's a problem later.

Now that's pretty much it for the plot, that may not seem like much, but it is a lot bigger in execution. Like in my previous review Samurai Champloo, the plot doesn't really have much of an overarching story, it's mostly vignettes and character pieces that delve deeper into the cast or are just fun adventures to watch. Unlike Samurai Champloo however, these vignettes do actually develop the characters and have some interesting themes or surprises in them. Some make you think, others make you laugh, Cowboy Bebop really just has a very large range of tone. This is probably one of the show's greatest strengths, it really knows how to use its characters and setting, it also takes them seriously allowing for a greater sense of immersion.

This is of course all thanks to the direction and writing. This was Shinichiro Watanabe's first full director job and what a great job he did. Not to mention the gorgeous cinematography and use of lighting in the whole thing. There is rarely a sour beat in the whole show with only a few episodes being mediocre. Of course this is also because of the shows head writer Keiko Nobumoto, who has written other amazing anime such as  Wolf's Rain and Macross Plus. With shows like that under his belt it's no wonder the show turned out to have some very witty and engaging dialogue, filled with great character interactions and being able to create any emotion it desires.

There's also the gorgeous music, which was done by the stellar composer and goddess of all amazing anime music, Yoko Kanno. The soundtrack can range from passionate jazz to quiet ambience of instruments. There's also the scene near the end of Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels, where they combine amazing visuals and great music to make you go into an orgasmic bliss. Really it's some stellar work by an already amazing artist.

Speaking of which both the openings and endings of the shows are also great. Tank!, which was also done by Kanno, is the opening for every single episode and get's me pumped to watch the show every time I see it. Not to mention it's hard not to tap your foot along to, it's probably one of the best openings ever conceived. The ending however, is a very passionate and beautiful ballad called, the Real Folk Blues. This ending while not my favorite is very good with a great vocals and visuals of Spike's past giving you a small glimpse of his character.

With that said and done, the animation is also gorgeous. This show was produced by Sunrise and if you don't know much about their studio, they have produced shows such as Gundam and Escaflowne, which also looked great. Cowboy Bebop also was one of the last shows to be hand drawn, instead of being animated digital technology used today. However, it's just as fluid if not better than a lot of shows that come out today. Also fun fact: while this show was technically made by Sunrise, most of the staff who worked on it later moved on to make Studio Bones who's first project was the Cowboy Bebop movie. So make take that as you may.

Then there's the world famous dub, which is even makes dub haters say, "If I watch a dub, it's Cowboy Bebop." Every character has the right voice and it, unlike many anime at the time, takes itself seriously enough to make it seem realistic. Steven Blum is amazing a Spike, Beau Billingslea gives Jet the right amount of grumpiness and reason, Wendee Lee gives an amazing performance as the arrogant Fei, and Melissa Fahn gives the right amount on insanity and smartness to the character of Edward. Not to mention all the side characters have great casting to, which I don't think even happened with the best dubs back then. There are very few, if any, stumbles in this dub and it has become an example of what all dubs should strive for.

So with all of these good things said about the show, does it have any problems? Well there are a few, but they are very minor so get prepared for some nitpicking. First off, Edward is kind of destroys the tone of some episodes. Now I'm ok with comic relief characters, really I am, but that's really one of Ed's only purposes. She is probably the least developed of the cast and while she does get a backstory, overall, she just kind of ruins some parts of the show. Not to say she like makes a whole episode of the show complete crap, that never happens, but she can seem just a little out of place in some of the shows 26 episodes. Really though, that's the shows biggest problem, besides that the other problems are mostly just extremely minor and won't ruin your overall enjoyment.

Verdict:
Really, there isn't much to say about Cowboy Bebop because really it's almost completely without flaw. There's no need to explain what's good about it because if there's something you don't like, there will probably be something you will like. There is nothing else I can say besides go see it, Bebop really deserves all the popularity and attention it gets. Before I go I'd also like to mention the Cowboy Bebop Movie, which is a basically just an episode of the show, but much longer and with equally great writing. I recommend that you watch it after you finish the series. Also this show was distributed by Bandai Entertainment, though there apparently going out of business, so you should probably get a copy before the show becomes really expensive. Then again, I doubt this show will stay unlicensed for long after Bandai's demise... So in the end, go see Bebop, you have nothing to lose except free time.

Score: 9.7/10 (Round that up to ten on MAL)

    Let be the one that forces down the hammer of judgment on this Anime, because honestly it is one of the Anime (and i rarely do this) that i really do not advise you to watch, if you are the one the feels attached to the characters throughout the story-line (i hope you get me on that one).

First of all i should say that in the animation, sound fields the Anime did pretty well considering the date in which the Anime was Aired. However i should say that the story-line failed miserably. It is rare for a 26 episodes Anime, to not have develop an

          
        escalating intensity of events as the story goes on, yet Cowboy Bebop demonstrated the utmost failure a writer could achieve. At the beginning of the story till before the last two episodes the story would be running in a direction(really boring direction), however, and i do not know why, in the last two it goes in a totally different direction totally irrelevant to what you have seen in the first 24 episodes. The Characters also fail, in result of the writer unable to decide what he wants to show out of them. Again i really do not know why they expect people to applaud to the ending. They wanted to make the ending look epic, i seriously thought that in the end it will be all like a dream a Character is having, i was shocked when it ended.

    If you've been a fan of anime for any length of time, chances are that you've come across a bunch of shows that people hail as nothing short of masterpieces such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Now, whether or not those programmes are perfection is entirely up to interpretation but if there's one programme which has been lauded as as nothing short of a masterpiece ever since its creation, it's Cowboy Bebop. Such a lofty title is not without those who question it, and indeed there are people who happen to dislike Bebop for a variety of reasons. I personally don't think that Bebop is a

          
        masterpiece (and I do consider it to be overrated), but I do see where the praise comes from. In fact, I do believe that Bebop deserves most (but not all) of the praise that it gets. Let's go into great lengths to find out why.

When it comes down to the actual story, it's rather disheartening to say that Bebop is lacking. The actual "plot" of the show is easily resolved within 4-5 episodes despite being 26 episodes long, so it might seem like there is a lot of filler. That's not really the case whatsoever, since Cowboy Bebop opts for a mostly episodic approach. With the exception of the 4-5 episodes where the plot moves forward, this is a show that you can jump into from virtually any point and wouldn't really get lost, provided you're familiar with the basic concept and the characters. In that regard, Cowboy Bebop may very well be considered analogous to something like Batman: The Animated Series in terms of both style and approach.

Unfortunately, Cowboy Bebop is prone to the same problems that episodic shows of its nature tend to have. If you don't know what I'm talking about, allow me to fill you in. While episodic programmes are easy to get into if you're a complete newcomer to a particular show, the quality of each episode tends to vary quite a bit. Some episodes are absolutely amazing while other episodes are rather tedious to get through. There's also the matter of certain episodes being a bit formulaic in approach. For example, you'd think that a crew of bounty hunters would at least catch a break every now and then but that's not the case at all. No matter what the situation, it's like the Bebop crew would always be down on their luck despite how skilled each member of the team is.

These might seem like relatively minor problems for a show that has a LOT of merits to stand on, but people often forget that this show is hailed as nothing short of a masterpiece. All it really takes is one relatively mediocre episode for someone with absolutely no prior knowledge of Cowboy Bebop to get a sour impression of this programme. So how would you remedy this? Obviously, you'd watch the episodes in chronological order, right? Uh... not exactly. The first four episodes aren't bad in the slightest, I fucking LOVE them as a matter of fact. But those first four episodes might not be the best introduction to a show lauded as much as Bebop is. If you really want my honest recommendation as to how you should view this programme, I'd say start out with Episode 5 just to get your general impression of the programme. If you like what you see, watch the first four episodes next and then keep watching in chronological order. The reason why you should watch it in that order if you're completely new to Bebop is simple: Episode 5 is a spectacular episode which contains virtually everything that this show is known for so if you don't like Episode 5, Bebop is most likely not going to be your cup of tea and if that's the case, watch Samurai Champloo instead.

With all that ranting out of the way, let's talk characters. The biggest strength that Bebop has when it comes down to its characters is the fact that they're played straight. This might not seem like such an accomplishment, but keep in mind that characters meant to be overacted were more or less the norm back in the 80s/90s so for its time, this was a rather huge deal. Another thing that Bebop's lead cast all share (for better or worse) are dark pasts that with the exception of Faye, they all try to avoid confronting. Why is this a good and a bad thing? On the one hand, a dark past that slowly gets revealed throughout the course of the programme makes for some awesome plot twists and they are given a fair amount of foreshadowing so the reveal doesn't come off as an asspull. HOWEVER... the concept of a ragtag bunch of misfits with each member having a dark past is a trope which has become rather commonplace in anime/manga over the course of recent years so chances are that some might find it rather clich which brings me to another point.

While the leading cast of Bebop certainly does a good job of carrying the story without feeling like cardboard cut-outs a good majority of the time, the fact still remains that they all fall under common archetypes and it gets a little too obvious at times. If you've ever watched a little programme called "Lupin III." you'll be quick to notice that Spike Spiegel bears somewhat of a resemblance to the much beloved Arsene Lupin III with a sense of humour to match (although nowhere near as exaggerated). For that matter, I guess you can say that Jet and Faye are more realistic versions of Daisuke and Fujiko if you want to keep making the comparisons (Jet/Daisuke being the voice of reason and Faye/Fujiko being the "femme fatale" so-to-speak). To be fair, I understand that Lupin III was one of the influences behind Bebop's creation. At the same time, I saw Lupin WAAAAY before I ever watched Bebop so the resemblance is rather uncanny to me. With that said, it's still nice to see an interpretation of Lupin, Daisuke, and Fujiko being played straight.

It's not like they remain static throughout the entire ordeal. With the exception of Edward who's more or less just the quirky and hyperactive computer genius (that still gets a bit of time in the sun regardless), everyone gets a fair amount of development and time on-screen so they're more than just the common archetypes like I've mentioned earlier and in some cases, actually feel like real people rather than you know... characters. With that said, let's talk about secondary/tertiary characters. A good chunk of the episodes introduce a new character whom the Bebop crew ends up dealing with for 20 minutes before their story is resolved by the end of the episode and they are quickly forgotten about. I suppose in that respect, Cowboy Bebop is similar to Mushishi. 

Unlike Mushishi however, Bebop actually does have recurring characters and they do what they do rather well without becoming a distraction. Of course, that still doesn't change the fact that I consider most of them to be like the cabbage merchant from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The standalone characters in Cowboy Bebop on the other hand are hit-and-miss for me. This goes back to the problem that most episodic shows tend to have with varying degrees in quality. Sometimes, I got REALLY attached to the character(s) introduced in one episode and was disheartened to never see them again and other times, the character(s) introduced in another episode were so dull to the point where I felt like the episode was dragging on. 

When it comes down to substance, Bebop falls a little flat so you may be wondering why you should even bother watching it if it's not the epitome of perfection. The answer is very simple: Cowboy Bebop is among the most influential anime of the 90s and its influence can still be seen to this day. In its heyday, Cowboy Bebop achieved a lot of success due to various factors. From its Space Western setting to the well-choreographed action sequences, a soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno consisting of mostly Jazz and Blues tracks to an amazing English dub where everything was played straight and was allowed to air uncut due to the fact that it was the first anime series that [adult swim] picked up (coincidentally on the same night the network made its debut), it seemed like the odds were stacked in Bebop's favour from the very beginning. Let's not forget the aesthetics because it would be a travesty not to do so. 

For one thing, this is the best-looking TV show from the 90s without a doubt, and to this day it still looks amazing. It's one thing for digital animation to be fluid, but to see that same sort of fluidity with cel animation where each frame was drawn by hand without losing any sort of detail whatsoever really just shows the meticulous amount of time and effort the blokes over at Sunrise put into the art and animation. That's actually kind of funny (in an ironic sort of manner) given that Sunrise was kicked off the animation team for Batman: The Animated Series because of the fact that nearly all the episodes that Sunrise took a part in had to be redone multiple times (or even re-animated in America) because of the fact that virtually everything was off model. I'm guessing that they were basically looking for a way to get back at Bruce Timm and Paul Dini for kicking them off the animation team, so they decided to basically bring out their A-game to their next project which just so happened to be Cowboy Bebop.

Going back to the soundtrack, what I love most about it (aside from the fact that it was composed by Yoko Kanno) is the fact that the OST isn't an afterthought of any kind since there are multiple scenes throughout the show which forgoes dialogue completely and instead rely on the music to actually convey the moment. It's the little things like this that make it so much more difficult for me to pick who's my favourite composer since the only other composer I can think of who'd actually do such a thing would be Kenji Kawai given that there were similar moments in the Ghost in the Shell films. What's more is the fact that a combination of jazz and blues among other such genres really helped give this show a unique flavour which has yet to be mimicked. Say what you will about Samurai Champloo being a carbon copy of Bebop when it comes down to story/characters, but one thing's for certain: Bebop's style is something that Champloo just cannot imitate (and that's a good thing, since Champloo's got its own style which works amazingly well for it).

Another thing that Cowboy Bebop has going for it? An absolutely spectacular English dub which is so good to the point where dub haters generally make an exception for this show. This goes back to how everything was played straight in Bebop from the get-go. In the past, English dubs of anime varied quite a bit in quality. Some dubs like the DiC dub of Sailor Moon changed up the dialogue so heavily edited for content and censored to high heaven to the point where it makes 4Kids' One Piece dub blush. Other times, dubs were actually pretty damn good (such was the case with Neon Genesis Evangelion and Yu Yu Hakusho) but were unfortunately butchered when they aired abroad due to the fact that those shows were airing on children's programming blocks and standards back then were much tighter than they are now. That was never the case with Bebop since it was aired on an adult programming block and as such, it was able to forgo most (if not all) of the censorship regulations during its broadcast on [adult swim]. Aside from that, we also had wonderful voice actors working on this like Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (fun fact: McGlynn also directed the English dub of Bebop) and a slew of many others, all of whom gave excellent performances.

Aside from the visuals and the audio, what other merits does Bebop have? Well for one thing, its style is something that allowed it to achieve widespread success with Western audiences. It's impossible not to notice that a good majority of anime these days require you to have some pre-existing knowledge of Asian culture in order to properly understand what's going on. Haven't you ever wondered why films like Akira and Ghost in the Shell (and to a lesser degree, Studio Ghibli movies) were huge hits back in the day? It was mostly because these were films that nobody needed any knowledge of Japanese culture to enjoy. Yes, Akira and Ghost in the Shell both took place in Tokyo, but it was really the the concepts, the gloomy atmosphere, the action, the blood, etc. which drew in Western audiences. It was taking place in Japan, and yet it didn't really feel like Japan at all outside of naming conventions, but that's a minor detail in comparison to everything else. It helps that unlike the former two, Bebop actually had virtually all the signs, posters and such in-universe written in English rather than Japanese in the original dub. Don't even get me started on the subtle cultural references and its film noir overtones because if I did, you'd be here for hours reading this review.

So when you combine all these things together, it's no secret as to why Cowboy Bebop is as lauded as it is now. I can certainly see why it wouldn't really be everyone's cup of tea (especially given some of the flaws I mentioned earlier). Regardless, its influence can't be denied. For all its worth, Cowboy Bebop is certainly a show that deserves most (but not all) the praise it gets. I get the feeling that if it had more of a plot to it and didn't rely so much on being badass and awesome to make people forgive its lack of a plot, it would definitely receive more praise than it already gets. The stage was set perfectly, so I question why Wantanabe and the rest of the Bebop team decided to opt for a mostly episodic nature when the ones where the "plot" actually progresses were nothing short of spectacular. Oh well, I guess it's too late to find out why... unless Wantanabe decides to do to Bebop what George Lucas did to Star Wars. Thankfully, Wantanabe seems to have more integrity than that.

Anyway, that's it for my first review on this site. Please be gentle, senpai.... (>/////

    At its core, Cowboy Bebop is the story of Spike Spiegal, Jets Black, Fay Valentines, Edward, Ion, Vicious, and Julia. But that's where the whole anime, in itself, drives a whole lot more in its 26 episodes. It leads us through a universe somewhere around 2080s space - I'm not sure, because in one episode one of the characters died in 2071 - where we still have the planets of the Milky Way, but because of the presence of orbital gates and space travelling and colonization, all the planets are now in themselves environments with interactive stories to tell. And yes, a lot of stories

          
        happen in either the planets (Jupiter, or Mars, or Earth, or Pluto), or their moons (like Titan, for instance).

For instance, Cowboy Bebop doesn't refer to either Spike or Jet, but rather the spaceship they use which has been named "Cowboy Bebop". Now, unless you had seen all the episodes, this small little thing might have been missed out. Its not a spoiler by any means, but it is stated to illustrate how the anime is presented.

While it is preferred to watch Cowboy Bebop in sequence, the episodes themselves are arranged like vignettes with only the characters forming the core bond holding them together. All of them. In the case of Cowboy Bebop, the best thing are well developed characters, even when they occur for one episode only. They not only interact with their environment (like bounty hunting, or hacking systems, or going to bars to drink, or even casual conversations between non-interactive characters who are very minor, for instance), but even amongst themselves are very... organic.

While the fight scenes and battle sequences in Cowboy Bebop are limited, they are nevertheless well handled. My personal favourite fight scenes are from the ending moments of "Hard Luck Woman". But in terms of personal favourite episodes, I'd choose "Pierre le Fou", "Cowboy Funk", "Mushroom Samba", and "Heavy Metal Queen".

In terms of characters, however, I'll be sadly blunt here, and by saying so I do solemnly want to inform everyone reading this review, that this is a massive spoiler, so be warned: Julia is a bitch. I'll not tell you why, but after seeing Cowboy Bebop, you'll realize this as soon as you reach the arc "The Real Folk Blues".

Cowboy Bebop has its moments of contemplation, and it also has its moments of melancholy as well, but it does its best to integrate these alongside countless other emotions into the universe it is set in. Again, I repeat, the universe Cowboy Bebop is set in, is very dynamic, and in this anime it is very well executed.

This is a classic by many significant anime standards, and it doesn't come as a surprise why most traditional anime fans tend to bash modern ones. Its a timeless tale, and it is presented well. And it deserves to be recognized.

All in all, a deserving watch.

    Let Cowboy Bebop serve as an example of why I consider praise for a series to be a spoiler in and of itself. For decades I have heard nothing but exaltation for Cowboy Bebop, and in the face of that kind of overwhelming critical and cult acclamation... it's hard not to be disappointed. If someone leads you to believe you will have your mind blown and your life changed, anything less makes the whole thing feel like they've made you put on a damp sweater. 

Maybe Cowboy Bebop is best considered within a particular social timeframe and cultural mindset. Maybe Cowboy Bebop is great because

          
        of the effect it had on a genre. Because I came to Cowboy Bebop almost two-decades late, however, none of that can bear upon my review of it. I can only review it as I experienced it. This is to say, I thought Cowboy Bebop was on the high side of okay.

I like the characters. They're fun, they're interesting, they have some depth (but not a lot of growth). I like the world and the setting. The series passed the time. That's kind of where it ends for me. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I'm not very interested in episodic, short-term story telling and I wish that there'd been a series-long arc covering the dealings with the Syndicate to tie everything together. As it is, each episode is just a cast of characters doing a bunch of random crap and remaining unchanged as a result. This kind of storytelling is deeply dissatisfying for me--there's a reason why serialized dramas are ruling TV these days and why self-contained procedural dramas don't win awards. 

Ultimately, I was disappointed that Cowboy Bebop didn't strive to do more, to BE more, given the perfect cast, setting, and set-up for an engaging high-concept story. Bebop is a series that is better discovered at random--late night on TV or on a shelf in a 00's video store--than it is discovered due to its acclaim. It's better experienced for what it is than for what it could or should have been.

    *SPOILERS FOR COWBOY BEBOP IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN IT SOMEHOW*

I'm sure that I'll hardly be able to add anything new here given that most of this show's praises have been sung more than the OST has been replayed by anyone who has seen the show, but what the hell? If Spike could go up against a Syndicate, then I can still find some things to say, at least presumably. Back to the preamble and enough of the rambling. Back in 1998, this wand the most popular show. Anime was just starting to really hit a boom with the US market, and back in the

          
        day, this was like, the show you'd always sneak out to your friend's house or purposefully break your 9:30 PM curfew to watch if you were a kid in middle-school. Nowadays, it's one of the most celebrated anime to date, with thousands upon thousands of loyal fans who always spread the series like a loud bang from a gun in a giant echoing hallway with people in it who somehow rejoice the sound (if you get the inside joke I made). Now why is that? What makes this series stand out as one of the few classic anime (10+ years old defines a classic if it's often considered great) to make it to the top 30, among the likes of Code Geass, GTO, Spirited Away, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes? What makes this to often be considered Shinichiro Watanabe's magnum opus? Well, let's find out, shall we?

STORY: 10/10

A large chunk of this series is set on individual missions for the Bebop crew to try and make some money off of, usually to fail due to unforeseen circumstances, like their bounty dying, or someone screwing everything over for them, or whatnot, and a lot of them are fairly episodic. Sure, a lot of them are used to flesh out bits and pieces of the Bebop crew in sometimes tragic ways, but there are just there to fill up the run time, at least that's what it feels like. The ultimate plot behind it is that Spike Spiegel was once part of the Red Dragon Syndicate, but after Julia starts falling in love with Spike, Vicious loves up to his name and takes everything over and chases after Spike, so in order to escape, he fakes his death and joins up with former cop, Jet, and together, become bounty hunters, or Cowboys, if you will. After some missions gone awry, a dog, a troubled gambler who was in cryostasis for 70 or so years, and a genius hacker who is also a little girl, all join the crew, to Spike's initial dismay. Before I dive into the real meat of what makes the narrative of the show so special, I have to call attention to their taste in music and culture as a whole, with each title being a reference to a song or even a style or genre of music, as well as episodes that are blatant references to certain types of film, like Mushroom Samba's blacksplotation or the city noir crime detective style of Ganymede Elegy. It's always fun to see a show's episode titles have that much care and style put into them, especially when there are series out there that put no goddamn effort into their episode titles at all.

This series does a great job fleshing out the characters piece by piece, revealing how tragic their back stories are, like those of Jet up until his individual episode in episode 10 and Faye until hers in episode 18 with the video tape from her childhood, which has to be one of the saddest moments in the show. This series also likes to convey emotion more than anything else, specifically the various emotions you experience through life, without resorting to melodrama, which is rather refreshing for a show that relies mostly on pathos, with scenarios like the bell peppers and beef scenes surrounding a tragic case in the first episode, as to signify that this is the crew's way of trying to let it not get to them as they live another day scraping by; eating while trying to put everything past them in order to not be miserable, even after the crew splits temporarily in episode 23. Episodes 12 and 13 are where things start taking a turn for the darker, as after another square off with Vicious, we start truly learning of how badly everyone has it, except arguably for Ed. Admittedly, we already got to see it with Jet a few episodes prior, but that's 1 out of 3. The first time we really get to see the overarching narrative for Spike is in episode 5, and this is sort of taking a back seat for more adventures and scenarios that flesh out everyone. In episode 24, we finally meet Julia, and this is the point where everything comes spiraling down, as in the last 3 episodes, the crew eventually splits for real, Spike meets Julia again, Vicious truly takes control of the syndicate by force, Julia is killed, and Spike storms the syndicate to face off with Vicious once and for all before dying by saying us catchphrase to the cops that surrounded the building, culminating in one of the best ending in anime akin to the likes of Gurren Lagann, and again, Code Geass. "You're gonna carry that weight" has been ingrained in the minds of just about everyone who has seen this show since, like the characters, we gotta live with our life choices as some of them come back to haunt us, a message that's infinitely more poignant for adults as they've already started coping with this.

CHARACTERS: 9/10

The Bebop crew is widely considered to be one of the most iconic main casts in anime history, and for damn good reason, from their lavishly executed backstories, to their charismatic nature. The man who embodies this most of all is of course, Spike Spiegal, a total badass who hates kids, pets, and women with annoying attitudes. He kicks ass with style and smoothness akin to Bruce Lee (even paraphrasing him and having a similar fighting style), and generally comes off as someone you wanna see in just about any scenario life can bring, which this show is always more than happy to oblige. He has this sort of charisma ther just gels with his combat. It sucks that his past sucks, but that's a key part of the show; that your past will always come back to haunt you until you put it to rest. Jet Black is a former cop who cooks bell peppers and "beef" (cuz there is none), and is a very stern man who hates it when Spike goes off on his own, because it often screws with the mission, and with the money. It's always fun to see the two interact, and in fact, it's always fun to see him interact angrily with anyone, and that's surprisingly hard to get right. Then again, this is Cowboy Bebop.

Faye Valentine is a gambler with an attitude, and a charming mistress who was in stasis for 70 years, uses gambling to wash it all away after the pain of being deceived by a man she was growing affection for in this new, advanced, and alien age. I think what really makes her the most depressing of it was is seeing what an adorable child she was and not only how much everything about her childhood home and friends have changed and disappeared, but just how much darker and more scheming she became. Ed is a hacker who, unsurprisingly, acts like a child, and even plays with the dog named Ein, since of course, he is one. All of them are really likable characters for different reasons, even of most other characters don't have enough screen time for us to really connect with them, especially when some of them die. Though, that's kind of the point. We see the crew having small interactions with these guys we'll rarely see again. Just like the crew, we're just people wandering into the tail end of their now tragic life stories, with one exception: Vicious. A renegade syndicate member who wants revenge and control, feeling betrayed by Julia's affair with his best friend Spike. A typical setup for the hellish rivalry between two friends. Overall, this still quite a lovely cast, especially the awesome and emotionally broken Bebop crew. If they didn't have such bad luck with cases, I'd bet lots of us would wanna join them.

ART: 10/10

Some of you may be (unjustly) disconcerted by how old and classic the artstyle is, but this is one of the most fluidly animated shows I've ever seen, surpassing the likes of FLCL, and for it to keep that up for 26 episodes, two whole seasons of anime, is damn impressive. The mid 80's to late 90's perfected anime shading, and this was one of the lucky series to recieve such treatment, especially when it comes to the small ship Spike often pilots. Hell, it looks more polished than most anime today, and it's been nearly 2 decades since this show aired. The show's rendition of the clsssic visual technique of Itano Circus (coined and originated by the legendary Macross franchise since its original installment), shown off in episode 4, is a sight to behold, as are the amazingly fluid fight scenes. Then again, considering how fluid Spike's Bruce Lee inspired fluid fighting style, it's only natural that the series would go that far. The character designs also look both impressively stylish as well as realistic, the latter of which is something you don't often see in anime. The OP in particular as this type of jazzy flare to the art that you'd never see in any other OP, and the ED has blue images, complementing the song's name. The explosions and action look very gritty, really nailing the impact of whenever someone chucks a gernade in the middle of a fight, and overall, this show is definitely worth watching for the crisp and fluid visuals alone.

SOUND: 9/10

The soundtrack was done my Yoko Kanno, and that just sells the show right there, doesn't it? A lot of the OST, while not inherently memorable, definitely captured whatever scenario the crew finds itself in during any given episode. Plus, with emotional songs like "Green Bird", "Stella no Moor", "Memory", Waltz for Zizu" (hey, Digibro used it emotionally), and "Good night Julia", how can you go wrong? The OP, "Tank" done by The Seatbelts, is a very cool and slick jazz song that amps you up for the show perfectly. You might find it contradictory that I said a lot of tracks aren't that memorable, only to list a lot of really amazing tracks, but there are so many pieces in the show that for even a decent fraction if the OST to be amazing, is to show how amazing it is as a whole. The ED on its own is pretty good, but the moment your tears truly fall is when you hear the full version of the ED "The Real Folk Blues" by The Seatbelts FT. Mai Yamane, which is a beautifully done emotional song with a final 2 minutes they can release the feels epically. 

The dub is often heralded as one of the best of all time, and I can't really disagree. It's up there with the likes of Gurren Lagann in terms of dub, which is really fitting given how amazing both shows are. All of the voices sound truly real, more so than most dubs or most performances of any show, and it all gels really well. Steve Blum does Spike Spiegel, and if you're a straight girl, you probably felt pleasure from that fact alone given this man's voice. Everyone else does a really great job as well, and rarely does it fell awkward in the slightest. 

ENJOYMENT: 8/10

Like I said, some of the middle episodes were almost fillery, and a bit boring (namely Mushroom Samba) but it was all worth it, not just for every episode that revealed much of any character's past, but also for the final few episodes. The show is smooth, and slick, like a good jazz song, and it often carried me through some of the weaker moments, followed by some really strong emotional moments. The show is definitely an entertaining one, and the badass yet tragic finale was definitely the highlight of everything. Looking back on and/or rewatching the show is when you truly appreciate the show's brilliance, and I wouldn't mind rewatching it sometime in the future.

OVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 92/10

This is definitely an impressive show that Watanabe worked on. It may not be a personal favorite, but I can easily see why someone would list it as one of theirs. It does a great job presenting the many different emotions of life, and does it brilliantly. Definitely a worthy show for anyone, especially one who loves to experience sci-fi. If you watch this show, you're gonna carry the weight, just like the rest of us. With all that said, I bid you adieu.

    This is the best anime ever made.

Why?

Because it isn't anime.

There aren't any anime conventions in it. There is no anime soundtrack. There are no schoolgirls, no tsundere, no moe, no giant robots.

This is a TV show.

Anyone can watch it and enjoy it.

It has a plot, but it's also episodic so you can just sit down and watch it. 

It's about bounty hunters, something Sergio Leone made popular--and put to good use here.

The characters are well put together with distinctive personalities (and an Homage to Lupin). Bruce-lee-esque Spike that looks like he's out of a 70s action flick, a Tarantino Movie, and stole his wardrobe from

          
        Lupin. Jet, the sensible foil to Spike--cop turned bounty hunter. Faye Valentine, the typical scantily clad woman. But her gambling problem, poignant backstory, and the fact she's out of place in the "future" world rounds her out perfectly. You could argue that the comedic "Ed," a hacker child, is the least fitting out of the four, but honestly odd episodes like Mushroom Samba and when she searches for her father seem to redeem that. And finally there's Vicious, the cold hearted syndicate killer and perfect antagonist to Spike. His katana to Spike's guns.

The settings are our solar system in the near future, with creative takes on each planet/moon--everything is beautiful and fitting, like Mosques on Venus, a sprawling Mars, crater-ridden Earth. Nothing extravagant, but the backgrounds are always there, noticeable, and fitting for the story. Shootouts in cathedrals, homage to kung fu, Tarantino, Leone. 

This is good because it's derivative of things that work. It has a great jazz soundtrack that doesn't fall prey to squeaky j-pop music and also matches the mood. The backstory is a simple one of the betrayal between men and women. The pacing is fast and uncluttered. 

And the ending is satisfying.

This is also the only anime where the English dub is peerless and so much more fitting than the Japanese version.

Watch it in order, or just watch one episode.

If you have to buy just one anime for your collection, you can't go wrong with this--the replay value is excellent, like watching your favorite childhood action films on the weekends that you never get sick of.

This is the exception to anime, not the norm. 

And something like this comes out every decade or two. It's impossible not to enjoy. If anime was more like this than the shit that's around now, it wouldn't be seen as a distraction for socially maladjusted shut-ins.

    Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics, and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of its characters and its music.

That anime is Cowboy Bebop.

Story

Cowboy Bebop is told as a series of standalone episodes, each of which is only really connected to one another by the characters, with very few of them directly following on from one another. This method of storytelling is now termed as &ldquo;episodic&rdquo;, and while the format is now commonplace in anime, this series set the standard

          
        in its usage, and many purists believe it to be almost flawless in its execution of this storytelling style. 

Sunrise, the production company behind the show, used this format as a tool to develop the characters in the show, and whilst many episodes are unique in terms of story content and plot, there is a strong connection to the rest of the series due to the strength of the characters, something which also applies to the movie Knocking on Heaven&rsquo;s Door.

One of the big advantages to the show's storytelling method is that it allows the viewer to jump straight into the story at almost any point, however it should be noted that many shows that adopt the episodic format are often let down by poor character development. The fact that the series manages to develop its characters, and develop them well, is a testament to the strength of the individual episodes as standalone stories, and the personal history of each character (which becomes clearer as the series progresses). In essence, Cowboy Bebop is a more about the characters themselves and their relationships with each other, than it is about their &ldquo;adventures&rdquo;. There are a number of episodes where the viewer may feel a strong connection to the characters, their history,mannerisms, pet peeves, etc, something which is difficult enough to accomplish in a normal sequential story. Achieving this in an episodic story is a mark of the quality of the series.


Art/Animation

The animation in Cowboy Bebop is amongst the best seen in anime, and even though it is now over a decade old, it still manages to hold its own in terms of animation and character design with more modern action oriented shows. Sunrise, who generally do an excellent job on animation, really pushed the boat out with this series, and when compared with other shows that were released around the same time (Outlaw Star for example), it can clearly be seen that the art, animation and character design in Cowboy Bebop is something special. The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and naturalistic.

The art, while not vibrant with flashy colours, portrays the feeling, attitude and environmental influences for the characters perfectly. The numerous locales which the crew of the Bebop visit are rendered in stunning detail, adding a surreal sense of realism to the show, whilst the character designs were a work of brilliance, and allows each character a mark of individuality even before they spoke.

Sound

The quality of the soundwork used in Cowboy Bebop is what really sets it apart from other anime series. The music was composed by the world renowned Yoko Kanno, and performed by The Seatbelts, a band specifically formed by Kanno to perform the music for the series. The music is a strange mix of blues, classic rock and jazz, and while at first this may seem an odd choice for a sci-fi series, the music works extremely well in the setting as it reflects the generally lackadaisical attitude adopted by the crew of the Bebop. Even today, the soundtrack for this anime is unique in terms of style and composition. The opening theme, Tank!, has become one of the most influential pieces in anime history, and one of the few anime based music tracks to be appreciated by music lovers with no background in anime or manga.

The sound effects in the series are also well done. The various locations are vibrant with background noises, from the hum of the Bebop's engines and the sound of gulls by the sea, to the hubbub of a crowded street. The many gunshots and explosions are clear and sound almost as though you're standing right in the middle of the wild gun battles. 

Whilst the Japanese voice actors do an excellent job with each of the four main characters, this is one of the rare anime shows out there where many prefer the English cast over the original Japanese. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime in existence where the English dub is equal to, if not better than, the original Japanese version.

Characters

Cowboy Bebop has some of the most original and memorable characters to appear in anime. Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are four of the most enigmatic individuals to found in the medium, and upon seeing them, the viewer will probably wonder how they work together when all of them come from diversely different backgrounds with opinions that clash with one another. 

Spike and Jet are most definitely &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; of sci-fi anime, or indeed any genre of anime you care to name. Their conflicting personalities bounce off each other like peas on a drum, and once Faye is added to the mix it becomes a potent brew of character interaction. It is through this interaction that the viewer is more able to empathise with each character, and the slow but steady revelations about their pasts, told wonderfully through flashbacks and reunions, have far greater impact because of this empathy. The characters are so well defined that many scenes which would normally appear mundane in other anime are just as memorable in this series as the action scenes (one springs to mind - Spike and Jet eating eggs after Faye, Ed and Ein leave the ship).

Enjoyment 

Cowboy Bebop is a sci-fi western with equal parts humour and seriousness, and is already considered by many within the anime community to be a classic. There is a level of sophistication in both the story and its characters that is rare for a show, regardless of whether it is an anime or not. The great cast, the heavy drama tempered with bouts of comedy, the excellent music, all serve to cement its place in the hearts and minds of anime fans the world over. It is a testament to its quality that there is only one show, anime or otherwise, that can be held up as a fair comparison (Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly). This is considered by many to be a &ldquo;must-see&rdquo; series as it is a testament to what can be achieved in anime with the right ingredients. 

The only downside to this anime would be the lack of a continuous story. Because of this, the series lacks the &quot;epic saga&quot; feel upon which many sci-fi stories are judged. However, the depth of each character, together with the strength of their individual stories, is more than enough to carry this series.

    Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop is one of the legends of anime.  It's a program most anime viewers have heard of regardless of whether they've watched it in full or not and thanks to the multiple airings it's received over the years on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block it's a small number indeed who've never seen at least an episode.  I can safely say that before I purchased Bandai's recently released complete collection I'd seen most of the episodes on television in one order or another so I wasn't watching anything strikingly new but this does mark the first time I've watched Cowboy Bebop

          
        in full from beginning to end in the order it was intended and as a result I feel I'm up to the challenge of writing a proper critique of what I saw.  The back of the case for my complete collection informs me that Cowboy Bebop was &quot;voted (the) greatest anime of all time!&quot;  Sale's pitches aside its an odd thing to say.  Unless you're a member of a doomsday cult I'd think it's safe to say we have a fair bit of time left till we have to decide what the greatest anything of all time was.  That said I had a lot of fun watching Cowboy Bebop and while I don't think it's one of anime's greatest contributions to visual media I can certainly see where it's reputation comes from.

Cowboy Bebop takes place in the year 2071.  Decades earlier a system of gates was established to allow for easy travel throughout the solar system.  However, due to a fatal instability in the gate system that was ignored by the contractors, a disaster known as the Gate Accident occurred.  As a result of the accident most of Earth's surface was destroyed and humanity spread out to more habitable places on or around other planets.  This leads to a kind of neo-Wild West scenario with the central government and law enforcement agencies in a weakened state leading to a kind of lawlessness.  It is an institutionalized system of bounty hunters that picks up the slack and this is the concept much of the program centers on.

The setting, as mentioned, is a kind of neo-Wild West in space, hence the &quot;Cowboy&quot; half of the title.  Unlike Trigun, for example, which takes place in a setting that, steampunk elements aside, is virtually identical to that found in American Westerns, Cowboy Bebop plays out in a setting very much like the present.  Its science fiction but the world is nonetheless recognizable as being our own.  Some elements stand out on occasion from the rest of the world as though they were transposed straight out of a typical American Western with little thought to consistency with the rest of the setting (for example the occasional conspicuous presence of individuals dressed in ponchos and sombreros), but it all works nonetheless to create an intriguing world for the story lines to play out in.

I tend to think that one the reasons for Cowboy Bebop's monumental success is the fact that it is a very fun, easy show to watch.  It doesn't make any demands on the viewer with its highly episodic nature and lack of any real overarching plot.  The closest Cowboy Bebop comes to having one is the story of Spike's past and even then it only occupies five episodes out of the total twenty-six. By and large, episodes either focus on the story of a specific bounty or on developing the main cast and their pasts and even though Spike's story is given the most attention it still suffers from the limited amount of time it receives.  In fact, if I were pressed, I'd have to say that the main story line is not exclusively about Spike's past at all but about everyone's.  The members of the crew of the spaceship Bebop all have troubled pasts which they all eventually have to face up to and that they will either overcome and move on or be destroyed.

To it's credit Cowboy Bebop possesses a well-developed essentially likable cast of characters.  Spike, Jet, and Faye are all interesting characters and even Ed, despite remaining largely a question mark throughout compared to the rest, is still a fun character to watch.  Problems arise, however, with members of the supporting cast, specifically those involved with Spike's past.  His past is revealed with a wonderful sense of subtlety throughout via the use of flashes of memory, succeeding to tell a complete story despite the time constraints.  However Spike's old associates from the Red Dragon syndicate don't come out so well.  Julia and particularly Vicious receive very little development.  Some characters from stand-alone bounty hunting episodes are more developed.  Often the most understanding that is provided about these characters comes solely from Spike&rsquo;s reactions to them which, to be fair, often proves to be enough.

On the audio/visual front Cowboy Bebop is quite the success.  Character designs by Toshihiro Kawamoto are consistently appealing and the animation is smooth utilizing a nicely done blend of two dimensional and computer generated animation.  For the purposes of this review I watched the dub for Cowboy Bebop which is regarded as one of the best with good reason.  All members of the cast fit their characters well and convey believable emotion when needed.  Yoko Kanno should need little introduction for her role in composing the soundtrack, focusing primarily on jazz while providing a fair variety of other genres throughout.  All in all a very high quality production even ten years later.

Overall, for me, Cowboy Bebop isn't a favorite, my main gripe being my issues with the story line.  However, despite that it proved to be a very fun, perhaps even addictive show to watch.  It has a wonderful soundtrack and a cast of characters well worth remembering after the final credit scroll.  For this I award it an overall rating of 8/10.

    I started because it's supposed to be a classic, but I was disappointed. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, such as the music. There's a different style of music every episode, reflecting the theme and setting of whatever's going on, which is pretty unique.
The main thing that turned me off was the story-line. There are a few recurring themes, but it is mainly episodic, with maybe one arc that lasts and entire two episodes. The individual stories of each episode are generally okay and sometimes go deep into the backstory of the characters, giving the audience a better idea of who they are and

          
        where they cam from. However there's just nothing to pull everything together. Each character has a few episodes to illustrate their backstories, but there's just nothing to pull it all together.
Overall, I think it's worth watching. It's a classic, and it's only 26 episodes. I just think that it was so over-hyped (being a classic and all) that I was just expecting more.

    Cowboy Bebop... widely considered as a masterpiece. I personally thought it was good, but I would have trouble placing it at masterpiece status.

I decided to watch Cowboy Bebop because it was done by Shinichiro Watanabe, who also did Samurai Champloo, which is one of my all time favorites. If you watched Champloo, Bebop is similar in that both follow an episodic format, where there is some kind of a story or plot, but the story itself is not as important as the journey. In Champloo, this was the search for the sunflower samurai. I guess in Bebop the main plot focus could be considered Spikes

          
        backstory and the whole situation with Julia.

Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters Spike and Jet and there adventures as bounty hunters and the other bounty hunters, Faye and Edward who they meet along their journey.

I think the most interesting part of Cowboy Bebop is I guess the main protagonist, Spike Spiegel. Although I do not necessarily the episodic format to be a bad thing, I feel that it sometimes took away what was the most interesting part of the show, which for me was Spike's backstory. Spike is a very interesting character - he is very mysterious, not to mention that he is very skilled at his job.

Overall 8/10

Had some moments which where interesting/entertaining, however I have trouble recommending Cowboy Bebop as a masterpiece as some people do. Still a show worth watching if you enjoy the genre.

    The story is pretty much episodic and not traditionally serial like the majority of anime. Each episode, they watch a show for bounty hunters that provide them information on the latest thugs that are out there ranging from petty drug dealers, to big time hitmen, and universally threatening terrorists. But I felt there are some certain episodes that the series could have lived without. Like episode 11 where a blob comes out of the refrigerator. 

What I really like about this anime is that it's very character driven. Like Spike despite having a very reckless nature and can crack wise jokes, tends to have a

          
        very indirect and not so straight forward personality if you try to have a normal conversation with him. He&rsquo;s not really anti-social, it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s not a people person, and is really private. Ed is just this whacky genius kid and you have no idea what goes on in her head. Faye is the freeloader. And Jet is who you can say is the parental figure aboard the bebop. These personalities equal to some very great chemistry and very realistic interactions because of how the characters express themselves and their general personalities. 

In terms of art and animation quality, this anime was the gateway between the 1990s and the new millenium. It perfectly mixes CG and 2D art. One of the other animes doing it that around this time was Initial D, which wasn&rsquo;t really as amazing as Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s but still cool. But Cowboy Bebop just perfectly blended it together and did not make you lose a certain grip of what you were viewing. 

The action of this anime ranges from John Woo style explosive stand offs, aerial dog fights, and martial arts. So you&rsquo;re getting everything in terms of action. A lot of scenes were influenced by Kung Fu and John Woo movies. Like the climatic battle in episode 5 is based on John Woo&rsquo;s the Killer, and all of Spike&rsquo;s movements when he does hand to hand combat is all based on Bruce Lee. His footwork, his stances, the way he lunges, all of it. And of course Spike is a student of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s martial arts philopshy, Jeet Kune Do, meaning the intercepting fist. There is one episode where he tries to teach a guy martial arts and he even uses one of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s famous and iconic quotes of &ldquo;be like water.&rdquo; 

The design is very distinctive and the characters are diverse but you see some references to other animes in it. Like Spike&rsquo;s clothing style and his color scheme does pay homage to Lupin III. And I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but Faye&rsquo;s design does remind me of Major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell with her look and the hair color being purple. The space ships are quite original and have a great design to them. They have excellent frames where it matches their aerial agilities in combat or in high speeds. 

Thanks to the addition of Yoko Kanno, then expect top notch music in this anime in its own respective style in compliments to the atmosphere. The jazz and blues soundtrack is one of the other most associative qualities this anime has that makes it so great. It flows so well with the action scenes by making you sit back and enjoy the excitement, and yet it also reflects the easygoing personality Spike still manages to maintain in his fights against tomato can opponents. And sometimes, it will have some more powerful sounding songs like Rain that goes so well with the scenery. Tank, the opening theme gives somewhat of an old school feel to it like you&rsquo;re watching a 1970s action movie and the song alone is good enough to show you&rsquo;re going to see something that goes beyond your expectations. 

Both the Japanese and English versions are excellent. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what version you&rsquo;re going to watch because both tracks just do an accurate job of making you feel the characters. However, my only problem with the dub is that the black co-host in the bounty hunting tv show sounds more like a southern white guy. But moving on, both Koichi Yamadera (the voice of Ryoga in Ranma, Togusa in Ghost in the Shell, and Kaji in Evangelion) and Steven Blum really bring out Spike&rsquo;s laid back, humorous, serious, and not so straightforward personality. 

Seiyuu legend, Megumi Hayashibara (the voice of female Ranma, Rei from Evangelion, and Lina Inverse from Slayers) and Wendee Lee approach Faye&rsquo;s character as being mysterious, captivating, broken hearted, and yet is somewhat of a motivator. 

And Unsho Ishizuka (the voice of Miyata-san from Hajime no Ippo, Sasaki from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Ken&rsquo;ichi, and Bunta from Initial D) and his English corresponding actor, Beau Billingslea, both do an excellent job of portraying Jet as being somewhat part comic relief, but yet has a grouchy personality at the same time and brings out the big brother/father figure to the Bebop. 

In the past, lots of people have talked about a sequel. This anime does not need a sequel. The ending is perfect. The director should not have gone out and said there is no conformation or any implication of what the ending really meant. I really love 100% conclusive endings. I rank this the 2nd best ending behind Ashita no Joe. But on the other hand, I can understand making a prequel. I&rsquo;d like to know how a run out cop and a runaway hitman teamed up to become bounty hunters. Like make a story of how Spike and Jet met. Make an OAV about Faye during her past. I like to know more about the characters to get a better understanding of them, and I feel this series would be a bit more complete, not saying the series is, but some of the small things did leave me curious. 

So if you like martial arts action, dog fights, John Woo, Dog the Bounty Hunter, sci-fi, and space opera mixed with a story that doesn&rsquo;t really have to be linear, but driven more by the characters, than this is for you. It&rsquo;s very, very great, but short of perfect.

         Cowboy Bebop is a household name to anime fans. Either you've seen it, or you've at least heard about it from your friends. Being one of the original anime aired in the US via Cartoon Network, it served as a gateway anime for many, a taste of what Japanese animation has to offer. Because of this, many people give it glowing reviews as a masterpiece, and a textbook example of what a good anime is. I am not of those people. I'm from the latter group of people, who heard the reviews about how good it was. So naturally, I

          
        had to see if the hype train was real, if it's really that good, or if people think it's better than it really is because of the sentimentality of it being(probably) their first anime. Here are my thoughts:

Story:6
     The story of Bebop is a bit convoluted, in the sense that it's a roller coaster of fillerish material and key plot points. What I mean by that is that the series definitely has its ups and downs, with the down episodes seeming to have no point to the overall progression(essentially filler), and the up episodes having lots of action and plot in a 20 minute block(these are of course, sprinkled throughout the 26 episodes). While Bebop does a great job of tying everything together into a cohesive story by the end, I found that in the midst of it, I could never expect what was going to happen in the next episode, which makes it hard to follow the story as you watch it. So overall, the story overall is good, but falls apart episode to episode. I wish the main plot was emphasized more throughout the whole anime, as opposed to the last 4-5 episodes.

Art:8
     The artwork in this anime is good, so much so that I was surprised when i found out it was 15 years old. Obviously it won't look as good as your 2014 summer anime, but the art style definitely complements the overall feel of the anime. I think if you redid the anime with modern animation, it wouldn't hold up well at all. You pair a sort of western feeling anime with a sort of choppy grainy animation, and it definitely works. No complaints here.

Sound:10
     What I said for the art holds even more true for the sound. In my opinion, the sound is what really carries this anime. The music in this anime is very jazzy, ranging from upbeat to emotional pieces, from the sultry orchestral opening to the subtle guitar/piano background music scattered throughout. I don't think the creators could have done a better job of pairing music with animation, because the music really does set the tone well. Even if you're not the type to actively listen to the music in your anime, I bet you'd be surprised by how easily you could pick out a song from Bebop if you heard it somewhere else. Hell, I bet if you gave me a piano I could learn the opening by ear, and that's saying something. It's that memorable.

Character:7
     The characters in Bebop are a likeable motley crue of varying personalities. No one is particularly fascinating(although the dog Ein is hilarious), but no one is particularly boring either. They're just a very normal, dare I say average, group. No Makoto-esque characters that make you want to swallow a spoon and/or yell at your screen(damn you School Days), and no *Insert stereotypical heroine from harem anime here*-esque characters with the emotional depth of a puddle. I will say that the characters are developed well throughout the anime, so the filler I mentioned earlier did serve a point. Although, considering your main cast consists of 4 characters and a badass dog, character development should be a given considering 26 episodes is significantly longer that your typical 12 episode animes, and you've got such a small cast to work with.

Enjoyment:7
     I usually judge my enjoyment factor by how many episodes I can watch in a row before I want to do something else, with 1 episode being painful to watch(School Days, Aku no Hana) and 5+ being "Holy shit! Is it that late already?!?"(A Certain Magical Index, Clannad). Bebop scores in the 2-3 range, usually 2. The reason I'm scoring that in the middle is because of the roller coastering(Adding that to dictionary) between episodes. You finish one episode that's awesome, and action packed, and makes you want to punch a stranger because "fuck yeah!".....and then the next episode is kinda boring. Usually I stop after a boring (and I'm using boring here to contrast the exciting episodes, not so much that the episode it self is terribly boring) episode, which is about every other episode.

Overall:7(Worth watching once)
     Overall, Bebop is a good anime. Is it worthy of the more recent Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online hype train that it still garners(For those of you who have been lambasted for not watching those while they were airing like me, you know what I' m talking about), I don't think so. It's worth a watch if you haven't seen it already, but it's not worth seeking out for anime enlightenment. It's not your anime Mecca, and I challenge anybody who thinks that it is to watch it again without bias, because I bet if you're one of the people who watched it when you were younger, you'll find that it's not as good as your remembered. You'll probably still enjoy it, but it won't seem as fulfilling the second time around.

    &quot;The work which becomes a new genre itself will be called Cowboy Bebop&quot;

Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows which can actually be called Epic.  Not an epic such as the Homeric poetry but epic as Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary says &ldquo;extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or scope.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s a word that shouldn&rsquo;t be used lightly.  Cowboy Bebop is the standard by which Anime should be molded after.  It achieves near perfection in creation and at the end there is a feeling of fulfillment.  No other anime has a more complete and satisfying ending.

The story element is

          
        where many great animes get their strength from but Cowboy Bebop is actually weakest here.  The story is very individualized, rarely do the events of one episode effect other episodes.  Yet despite this &ldquo;episodic&rdquo; design, actual plot is occasionally used and by the end it feels like the plot has always been a part of the show like a shadow that had just been noticed.  

In other anime I can&rsquo;t think of too many action scenes that can come even close to those in Cowboy Bebop.  Motion is almost always drawn smoothly and action scenes are incredible to watch.  As Spike says, &ldquo;like water.&rdquo;  The artists did a superb job in being able to create a certain mood through lightening and the vibrant/dull of colors.  The artwork altogether is incredible and visually everything feels natural.  

The sound was particularly enjoyable.  There was a good amount of jazz music which fits Bebop well due to the uncertainty which is the foundation of jazz music.  I wasn&rsquo;t too fond of the opening theme though(I&rsquo;m probably the only one).  But in eps 5 near the end and at the conclusion of eps 26, the music is beyond incredible.  It honestly speaks about the show in ways words could never describe and help elevate Bebop to levels rarely achieved.  But like I said, for some reason I hate the opening theme.  

Because the story is sort of &ldquo;weak&rdquo; the characters are the driving force of the show.  This is where Bebop is made.  The characters are all vastly different and don&rsquo;t really fit any particular clich&eacute;s, which is quite refreshing.  All you need to know is that you won&rsquo;t find more original and more entertaining characters anywhere else.

If this anime doesn&rsquo;t speak to you or inspire you, don&rsquo;t worry because it is extremely fun to watch.  Bebop won&rsquo;t put you in stitches for the full 20 minutes nor will it try to force you to enjoy the show.  Instead it does it&rsquo;s own thing and you can&rsquo;t help but smile while watching.  The Bebop crew is just pure fun and I guarantee you will enjoy it.

Conclusion:  Cowboy Bebop is not my #1 personal favorite show, but it is the most complete and perfect anime out there.  It is in all sense of the word, A Masterpiece.  Bebop may not be exactly what you want for an ideal story anime, but in no way does that take away from it.  The light hearted and random episodes are fun all the way through.  The characters are very likeable and create a great atmosphere.  The visual style and sound combine with the other elements in a perfect blend to make a perfect show (or as close as you can get).  This may not be your favorite show but you will not be disappointed and at the very least you will finish with a smile feeling as satisfied as if you finished eating a great meal.

    What is the measure of a classic? 

The dictionary would suggest that a classic is: n. is an outstanding example of a particular style; something of lasting worth or with a timeless quality; of the first or highest quality, class, or rank  something that exemplifies its class. Something that stands the test of time, is remembered fondly, and has continued appeal. 

Historically, the world classic itself typically imbues a connotation of antiquity- Greeks, Romans, ancient literature, artwork, even music. It inspires originality and derives from that a long-lasting impact.

The audience would likely suggest a less abstract definition and instead give examples. In film, you'd

          
        get a Citizen Kane or a Sunset Boulevard or a Rear Window. In television, a wider range of things.

There are even such things as "modern classics", like my beloved Ringtone Rap.

In anime, the definition of classic- well... that debate is still hotly contested. One name, that continually rises up through sifting of the ever growing mound of coarse sand that is anime however, is that of Cowboy Bebop. 


Bebop checks off all the boxes for an enduring, beloved series- it has the characters, it's easy to follow, it's got the tunes, a tightly controlled artistic direction that sets it apart from the rest of the pack, and most importantly- it's entertaining. There is a reason why certain shows like Seinfeld, Spongebob, Andy Griffith, The Flintstones, Friends, Star Trek, and many others continued to air on TV long after their expiration date: accessibility. Many of the longest running shows on television center on a long running, slow unfolding story arc, often involving a large family or group of them- such as Dallas, the Sopranos, or Game of Thrones. They tell interwoven stories with a myriad of characters over a period of years, and as such, length of the show is hampered only by the creative output of the creators. 

To create such a show that, within its relatively short length of 26 episodes (everything listed above numbers in the hundreds of episodes, or will, by the end of the run) manages to cover such a wide range of topics and stories in a self contained format is a feat indeed. One of the most common criticisms of scripted shows like this are their episodic or short arc nature. The people want a singular story to follow- a goal, a direction. Episodic series often feel uneven in tone and pacing, not to mention disjointed due to the constant shift and restarting that's necessary to keep the show accessible to new viewers who may not have seen previous episodes. 

Cowboy Bebop doesn't necessarily rely on viewers to have seen all of the preceding episodes to be able to enjoy any given episode, and to me, this is one of the great charms the show has- the ability to pick it up wherever, and enjoy it. I think this is also why it's had lasting success on Adult Swim since its original airing in 2001. Bebop is a lot of fun to watch, no matter where in the series you pick it up; and that enjoyability is due in no small part to the writing and direction. Certain long running shows can have very interesting plots, and be loaded with poorly written characters, but still manage to garner a large viewing audience who want to follow along- shows that have intriguing concepts, but poor execution. 
For an episodic series like Bebop to succeed, the emphasis doesn't necessarily need to be on making every single story plot the most interesting and wacky thing out there, but rather to be anchored by /characters/ you want to watch interact and react to situations. Indeed, it is characters that drive this story, and not the other way around. 

A show's greatest sin is to be unentertaining. If a show is "boring", it has failed at its' most fundamental level- being entertainment. 


Boring, Bebop is not. The characters are unique, and how they work, play, and fight together is decidedly endearing. Each character has their charm and their wit. Spike, the central protagonist, is a mysterious James Bond-esque man of many skills- particularly in combat. Throughout the show, there are several overarching questions about his past, which are revealed through about 5 episodes throughout. However, this kind of information about the character is really just a bonus, because it takes all of one episode to know what kind of character he is: the sharp dressing, sardonic, quintessential cool- cigarettes, guns and all. He's not without depth or flaws, however. There's more behind the man than the mask of calm, cool, and collected. 
He is set opposite the very antithesis of calm, cool and collected in Faye- a beautiful young woman with an equally mysterious past that's explored in several later episodes. She plays an important role in the team though, instead of just being the token female or there for fanservice. She's another multifaceted character with more than meets the eye, and frequently steals the spotlight. 
The trio is rounded off with Jet- the "I'm too old for this crap" retired cop archetype. Jet exists as the grounded personality between Spike's frustration and Faye's outbursts, and generally serves as the voice of reason between the two extremes: his crewmates, hothead and impulsive. 

Soundwise, the show is superb. I make no secret of being a fan of Yoko Kanno, but this is the show that catapulted her to stardom in the anime industry. It's got a fantastic blend of moody orchestral pieces juxtaposed with the titular bebop jazz. There's funk, there's electronica, and there's even an episode devoted to heavy metal. A more diverse soundtrack you are unlikely to find, and there will certainly be something for everyone to enjoy with such a variety of tunes. As far as the voice acting goes, Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, and Beau Billingslea all do fantastic jobs as Spike, Faye, and Jet respectively. 

The art, too, is fantastic for the time. In 2017, Bebop could be considered an "old" anime, clocking in at a geriatric 19 years of age. Don't let the number fool you though, as the hand drawn art maintains a great consistency in quality and fluidity throughout the show's run. The show features a great variety in locales, vehicles, and characters. Due to the episodic nature, very few episodes take place in the same locations, and a number of different themes in art direction show up in the show. There are full on neo-noir episodes, complete with the black and white look, detectives, etc. and other more darkly colored ones with slow fades to reveal a what looks to be a puddle is actually blood. There are a number of western themed episodes, mafia, casino, and others. Definitely no shortage of different motifs. 

One of my favorite episodes was the magic mushroom episode, where, due to a food shortage, Spike, Faye, and Jet all end up eating psychedelic mushrooms they've mistaken for portabellas, and it's up to Edward to actually track down some real food. Though it's a silly episode played for laughs, it actually succeeds in taking a needed break from the action. The "Pierrot Le Fou" episode, which reminded me heavily of the 1992 Batman Animated series, involves a superhuman test subject that resembles The Penguin, who loses his mind and goes nuts, attacking anyone and everyone. The episode is downright creepy, and Spike's showdown with him at the end is quite clever, and, as mentioned before- really seems like a Batman episode. 

That said, and being episodic, some episodes are a mixed bag. A few that are supposed to be touching just felt a bit out of place, and others that were more comedic in tone fell a bit flat when it involved someone other than the main three. The recurring "Spike and Faye manage to screw up somehow and lose the bounty they're hunting, or they unexpectedly die" gag wears thin pretty quickly, and the formulaic nature of the first few episodes gets kinda old, too. The second half of the show is definitely where it all comes together though, and the ending was rather unexpected for a show of this type, and succeeded in grabbing me by the heart. 

All that to say: Cowboy Bebop is exactly what I would consider to be a classic.  

See you, Space Cowboy.

    (7.0/10)

Cowboy Bebop was one of the first few anime that I properly sat down and watched. After the horrible atrocity that was Fate/Zero I asked my friend to give me something "a little different", perhaps a little more "western" in its storytelling. Mainly because I had some pretty ignorant assumptions on cultural storytelling back then. 

Well, he was nice enough to give me Cowboy Bebop. A show he described as, "the most western anime ever." Cool. I sat down and watched it in about a week. 

I left with a few mixed feelings, but overall, it was a positive experience that I think many anime

          
        fans rightfully call a "classic" in the medium. Much like the show, i'll break up this review into small digestible chunks. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

PART 1 : The Purpose of a Genre 


Television works in funny ways. Well, not really funny as much as generic, obvious, and pandering. Even in Japan, where the entire culture is different than America's, the way television (and film) is created is still similar. The demographic of the script is determined, the show/film gets its director and production company, it gets funded, and the shooting begins. That's one of the many ways something can get started.

The key term here is demographic. Everything is made for an audience, and that audience is everything for what's being made. Put simply, if no one is watching and buying; then your product is caput. The way you make sure that at least someone will watch and buy is by determining something called a demographic. Which pretty much means the sex and age range of an audience. 

For example, a show like Sword Art Online is made with the 13-17 male demographic, however, it has reaches into the 18-27 male demographic as well. The show is adapted from the manga(or is it a LN i'm not sure) with the same key demographic. So a bunch of people come together and talk about what people in that age like. 

Titties : Check

Loud anime yelling : Check

Self-insert wish fulfillment : Check 

Flashy animation when fighting actually happens : Check

...

With these concepts they created the most generic and marketable show possible. Their show is the literal equivalent of oatmeal with nothing on it. Something that's easily edible. 

But the point is that these people created this show with this audience in mind. This means that the show excels (hopefully) at these certain things. If you need fan service to appeal to a bunch of horny teenage boys, then you try your best to make it be some really damn good fan service! If you need loud moralistic anime protagonist, you better get the most generic possible self-insert wish-fulfilling protagonist you can! 

So while this show may suck massive meat-wagons its still a show that excels at those things. 

...

This leads me to Cowboy Bebop. A show that doesn't really excel at anything. A show that doesn't really fit in a base genre. Sure people sometimes call it a "space opera" but that's a horribly defined genre, in my opinion. It pretty much encapsulates every possible base genre. It has comedy, horror, drama, action, and mystery. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

PART 2 : Lack of a Flavor is More of a Flavor


So what exactly does "it just kinda does everything pretty good", mean? Well for one it means that I came out of the show thoroughly...fine. Nothing really stood out as mind-blowing or even great, but everything flowed decently well that I never really found the show to be a slog to sit through. The entire thing felt so harmless. 

Its attempts at emotion were fine, its action was generally pretty good, the detours into more experimental one-off episodes was fairly pleasing as well. It had a decently designed cast with a cute little dog cause signature pets are cool to have. It had a story that flowed well, although wasn't given enough time to actually become something special. It followed an episodic structure that felt good to watch but ultimately didn't add much to the show... more on that later. 

With this lack of focused genre, it really felt like the show was just middle-of-the-pack on everything. Which is why I can't really bring myself to criticize all too much. It quite literally does almost everything well enough that I don't have much to say on it. 

Our titular protagonist is a charming semi-douche that is ultimately more like-able and interesting than most anime protagonists. His companions are all fairly engaging too. Faye has a great character design, Jet has a nice presence, Edward is ultimately the comedic relief and so on. 

Point is, the show is just good. Throughout all the episodes, which play out very episodically, I found myself not having any disdain towards any of them. Sure most of them weren't all too memorable... the standouts being one with mushrooms, one with a fridge, and one with a fat man floating around like a balloon. But overall, they had some decent sci-fi storylines with decent execution. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

PART 3 : Story Without Story 


So the one thing that bugged me about the show was its execution of the main storyline. While its episodic by nature, every half-way point we have a story-driven episode that revolves around our protagonist, Spike. I won't spoil what its about but it involves love and heartbreak, duh. 

So with these story-driven episodes, the show shifts from meandering fourth gear to a full-out lore-mode fifth gear. The switch doesn't often feel natural, but the episodes themselves are all generally pretty good. 

However, the biggest issue is that the writers don't give these stories enough time. I can think of a handful of disconnected episodes that could've been cut in favor of creating a more interesting and believable story. 

Since this whole story-arc literally takes only five episodes to resolve, the other twenty one episodes are just kind of there. Five episodes is hardly enough time to create any believable characters or engaging interactions that lead to a very bombastic conclusion in a way that feels emotionally powerful.

Specifically, Spike's love from his past, Julia, gets a truly pitiful amount of development. This creates scenes that are meant to be emotional into yet another "ok" scene. It doesn't feel bad as much as it just feels "ok". 

But the reason I feel like i can't give a show a pass for this is because they played this entire thing out like it was supposed to be something bigger. A big arc. But they didn't give it enough time. Why do an episodic series of twenty six episodes and only give the story five? Especially if you only want one season? It felt like a nonsensical idea to me. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Conclusion : 


Honestly, this review seems harsher than it needs to be. Saying the show is "mediocre" would mean its a 5.0/10. Its not mediocre. Its definitely above average, and the character interaction, for the most part, is good enough to elevate the show. 

It has some very well choreographed fight sequences and some very genuine moments. Its overall a very pleasant show to watch. For me, it isn't the untouchable classic that many may call it, its still a good time that i'd recommend to any fan of television. 

It may have not thought out its base storyline enough to make it something special, but some of the standout episodic episodes do more than enough to create a smooth and memorable experience. 


See you in the internet, bubbo.

    What can I say about this that hasn't been said before?

This was the show that got me into anime, which looking back at how much time I've lost to it since might not have been such a good thing. There's just something about this, it's easy to feel but hard to pin down. The characters have incredible chemistry, the english dub is one of the best ever recorded, the art style is beautiful and stands up well for it's age, and the soundtrack is probably the strongest I've ever heard. You can tell that the creators had a lot of fun making this because there

          
        are so many unique pieces that all fit together in the end product. It's sort of timeless, and I don't think it'll ever stop feeling cool. I keep this show about 5 feet from the DVD player at all times, and this is the first show I recommend to anyone asking me about getting into anime. It's not nostalgia, it's just great. Without a doubt, it was the best of 1998, which had Trigun, Serial Experiments Lain, and Outlaw star all come out then too. If you haven't seen it, but you watch anime, what is wrong with you? This is one of the biggest pillars in anime history, you owe it to yourself to see it.

    I think its quite saddening that I don't have anything better to do than writing a review. On christmas! However, this really needs to be done at some point, and while other people are eating cookies, I'll do this one: Cowboy Bebop Review Mk II. New and improved, rated by my new guidelines!

First of all, yes, I still dislike Cowboy Bebop, and even without rereading it I still remember the opening phrase from my first review. I'll refrain from it this time though, because at some point I stopped caring about whether I like that particular anime or not, I just want to give a

          
        fair rating.

Story is for me defined by its Main Plot, the setting used, as well as the execution of the storyline.
First, for the main plot. The most episodes are without any relevance to the main plot. They neither help to develop the cast, nor do they illustrate the setting. They are filler. Nothing more, and nothing less. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think its a viable option to spam filler after filler without even explaining what the anime is about. When I first watched this anime I lost interest after a mere 3 episodes and dropped it (For reference, by now I watched this anime like 3 times only for review reasons). But without filler episodes, what is actually left? A story which couldn't be more cliche. A story of two former friends, who fell in love with the same woman.
Revenge, bloodlust... The usual stuff.
As for the setting: To be honest, I don't have the most experience with science fiction, but I feel like this is one of the worst tries. The Ring travel system doesn't make sense in the slightest, nor do the spaceships. The first thing that comes to mind is Spikes space ship, the SWORDFISH II wouldn't be able to even navigate in space. Much less in the atmosphere. Well, crash and burn, Spike. I guess.
Execution: I think I already mentioned that Fillers before the story isn't exactly the best way to hook the audience. As for the main story, I already said that it's a rather cliched one (everything beyond that would be spoiler). Well, you get the picture.
So overall: We have a B-Movie storyline, sprinkled with fillers (1/3), a logically flawed setting (1/3), and a rather bad execution which never hooked me up (1/3). Overall 4/10 for the story.

Next is the Artwork, which not just considers the Artworks for the characters, but also the background, as well as the fluency of animation (especially during battlescenes).
To be blunt, compared to other anime of that time Cowboy Bebops artworks aren't anything bad. They do their job just fine without being groundbreaking or breathtaking.
The backgrounds on the other hand are rather often undetailed, and I can even recall scenes in which parts of the screen were whited out (without being flashbacks). This leaves the animation, which is as always in Watanabes works, quite flashy, but only style and no substance. The choreography is pretty bad.
Summing it up: The character artworks are up to par (2/3), while the backgrounds and animation are quite lackluster (1/3 for both). Overall 5/10 for art.

For the sound I rate the voiceover (japanese dub only), as well as the OST/BGM, and the OP/ED. So, lets kick it off with the Voices. I don't really like the japanese cast, which, in my opinion, fail to express any feelings their characters might have. Without the video and subs I couldn't imagine whether the characters are sad, happy or whatever. Overall a pretty bad performance. The english cast on the other hand was pretty damn good, and I have to give credit to them, this is one of the best dubs I know. As for the OST I wondered why I couldn't remember even a single track. After rewatching an episode I knew: Because there is next to none OST most of the time. The few OSTs presented are more to underline the plot, but on their own don't really pack a punch. Lastly, the OP/ED Themes. I don't really like Blues to begin with, but I don't really feel like the theme fits Action-headhunter stuff too well. It felt more like some detective story or the like, at least to me. As for the ending 'The Real Folk Blues' fits way better and brings closure to each episode.
Final scores for sound: Bad japanese cast which produces no feelings (1/3), next to nonexistant OST with forgettable tracks (1/3), and a mediocre OP, but okay ED (1/3).
Sums up at 4/10 for sound.

Characters should preferably have some catchy initial designs, good relations with their surroundings, and a good development. which is why I rate characters in there 3 categories.
Initial designs: I don't think that Cowboy Bebop reinvented the wheel with their characters, but they fulfill their purpose. Jet as that cop who left the police to deliver justice on his own, the more or less sexy girl, and the easygoing main lead.
Unfortunately I never felt like they had any relations with each other. None of their interactions with each other, but also with the surroundings felt real to me, because basically they had no counterparts they could greatly argue with.
As for the development, quite honestly, I don't think that any of the characters had great development. Thinking bad I can't recall much of a development to begin with. The Spike from Episode 26 will act like the Spike from Episode 1. Or 4. Or which episode you want to choose.
Same goes for most other characters, with only Faye being the exception.
So overall the characters are rather disappointing, especially since they started with promising designs (2/3). But their Interaction was nonexistent (0/3), and the development was poor (1/3).
Overall 4/10 for the cast of Cowboy Bebop.

Enjoyment. Well, thats something everyone should decide for themselves. For me at least its a 1/10. Why? Because I answered these questions honestly:
How much did I like the seen episodes (0-3)?
How much do I want to see the story continue (0-3)?
Would I recommend it to someone? (0=no, 1=yes)
Would I watch it again, just for fun? (0=no, 1=once, 2=muiltiple times)
Quite honestly, for me the obvious answer is No, no, and No! And No!

Overall: Well 3,6 is pretty... bad. I don't like it, but if you do... Feel free to do so, thats called taste.
Tl;dr: Forgettable story with lot of flaws and filler, acceptable artworks, rather weak OST and voiceovers, and a weak character development.

I'm always open for feedback, thanks in advance!

    Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime that truly impressed me. 
One of the first anime that convinced me the anime genre as a whole had something going for it, that anime has qualities that separate it from other forms of entertainment.
It is a show that has withstood the test of time and is often viewed as a masterpiece by many. With such popularity and praise there is bound to be a group of the opposite extreme that dislike the show. Now I bear in my mind that although this group is a minority their points are valid. As a reviewer I look at

          
        all angles and try my best to keep bias at an all time low.
Having said that, regardless of my attempts to locate the flaws of this show my overall consensus is that Cowboy Bebop is in multiple ways a masterpiece.

Here Goes The Review (Spoilers are at a Minimum)

Story~9.5
When most people think about what society would be like by the time space exploration is achieved they imagine a society that is more organized, coherent, and advanced. This is one of the key misconceptions that cause Cowboy Bebops story to shine.
We start our episodic space journey in an environment that is futuristic yet in many ways primitive. Watanabe Shinichiros depiction of the Cowboy Bebop universe seamlessly fuses the attitudes and tensions of a western shooter with the atmosphere of vast unexplored space. Due to the inability of the police to handle all criminals in such a large area bounty hunting is encouraged through media. Our four main characters (discussed more in the character section) just so happen to be bounty hunters that are all unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. Furthermore, little to no background information is given about any of the characters from the beginning. Each character has a past that is hinted throughout many episodes. Slowly, the audience learns of the sins, misfortunes, and tragedies that quietly haunt those aboard the spaceship of Bebop.

And so this is the world us, the viewers, are thrust into and what an amazingly unique barren world it is. Being for the most part episodic, viewers may be deterred by the looseness and seemingly pointlessness of certain episodes. Be aware that although episodic, each episode develops the characters and is key to forming the bonds that will ultimately culminate the multiple climaxes of the story.

Art~9.5
Do not let age fool you. Despite being over a decade and a half old the animations in Cowboy Bebop are amazing in providing the dangerous rugged environment of criminal filled space. In fact, the 1998 art is more of a positive than a negative. Gone are the crisp saturated art of modern day. The outdated animations contribute greatly to the classy western style of the anime. Everything from the smoke of cigarettes to guns ablazing are portrayed brilliantly. The choreography of martial arts and space flight is done in a fluid and smooth fashion. The characters look great and production never seems to dip for a single moment.

Three simple words can summarize the art: Rugged yet Classy~

And so in trying my absolute best to pinpoint the flaws of the art I am both reluctant and glad to announce that I have failed in doing so. Cowboy Bebops art is amazingly well done even for todays standards. Knowing in the back of your head that this art originates from 1998 is just icing on the cake.

Sound~10
Earlier in my review I talked about how with much praise and popularity ultimately spawns a group with ideals of the opposite extreme. I wholeheartedly believe that it is safe to say that regardless of your ideas about Cowboy Bebop, everyone can agree that the music in this anime is absolutely amazing. So amazing that without the music I believe that Cowboy Bebop would never have achieved the success it has had to this day.
Never have I come across another example such as Cowboy Bebop where the music is such an integral part of the show.
From the Blues riffs of slide guitars to the unmatched soul of harmonica solos, the music in Cowboy Bebop does its job 110%. To say that the the music is fitting would be an understatement. Cowboy Bebops music boosts the atmosphere and situation of every scene to its highest potential and provides a convincing atmosphere like no other.

The dub of Cowboy Bebop is the arguably the most highly praised dub ever produced in the anime industry. Watanabe Shinichiro himself has even stated that he believed the English dub surpasses the Japanese dub, a feat that is notoriously rare. Every characters voice is portrayed brilliantly with every word filled with real human emotion. Convincingly raw and powerful, I have yet to stumble across another instance where the voice acting was this well done. I honestly can not think up a single flaw of the voice acting even while keeping bias at a minimum. The English voice acting is truly a one of a kind in a world of horribly ear wrenching dubs.

The OP and the ED of Cowboy Bebop are probably one of the most popular Opening and Ending Themes of all time. The OP ("Tank!" by The Seatbelts) is a jazzy explosion of adrenaline. Listening to it is a joy and pumps the viewers eagerness to watch the episode. It keeps you on your feet and is in many ways the most famous trademark of the Cowboy Bebop series. The ED for most of the show ("The Real Folk Blues" by The Seatbelts feat. Mai Yamane) is equally as amazing but instead of pumping the viewers eagerness the ED in turn helps the viewer digest what was just displayed on the screen. Listening to the ED causes heartwarming scenes to be that much more heartwarming while heartbreaking scenes to be that much more heartbreaking. The Real Folk Blues is a beautiful jazzy blues inspired song sung over with Mai Yamanes powerful voice. The ED only changes twice in the anime, each change being only for one episode. As a reviewer I would not feel right about spoiling the timing of the ED changes because they are in my opinion some of the most powerful moments of the anime. And so this last bit I shall let the viewer experience.

Character~10
Cowboy Bebop has one of the most memorable casts of any show I have ever watched. They are eccentric, unique, strong willed, and powerfully convincing.
We have Spike Spiegel who is a male bounty hunter in his late twenties that is trying to escape an inescapable past; Jet Black, the father like figure of the spaceship Bebop who has been stricken by unjust tragedies; Faye Valentine, the strong independent con artist who is kept in the dark about her own life; and last but not least Edward, the androgynous female teenage hacker with a background as confusing as herself. 
As mentioned earlier they are for the most part unwillingly bound together by greed, revenge, coincidence, and or desire. This is what is so great about the characters in Cowboy Bebop they all start off the show hating each other!
The reluctant and slow change of their relationships is humorous,real, and convincing.

The climatic points of the show are the episodes in which bits and pieces of each crew members past is slowly revealed. We get to see and feel what they were hiding and the raw emotions that they feel. Each character is its own little mystery that keeps the audience in the dark. 

Easily the most impressive aspect of Cowboy Bebop is the portrayal of the characters. The crew deals with grief, anger, sadness, and all else in their own unique ways and rarely deviate. How Shinichiro portrays this uniqueness is simply amazing. The characters NEVER falter and always stay true to themselves. As the episodes roll by, the audience starts to understand why each character acts the way they do and can relate. This understanding makes it unbearably easy for the audience to become emotionally attached to each crew member as we share their pain and memories.

All in all, the characters of Cowboy Bebop are outstanding. Their strengths overcome their flaws when united as a whole. Beautifully drawn and creative, Shinichiro has invented a golden cast.

Overall/Enjoyment~10
Even after watching dozens of anime after Cowboy Bebop it still strongly remains one of my few masterpieces.

    Since being a critic means writing tons of words, people often think of us as pretentious assholes who cant have fun. Some critics swallow that crap and then write meaningless bullcrap instead of admitting they enjoyed a stylish, flashy story. The easiest way to recognize it is when a series is said to be about existentialism. Thats so general, but so useful. After all, that stream of philosophy is huge and you can insert anything into it.

Since I dont care about my image, Im not going to claim Cowboy Bebop is about existentialism when I cant back it up. I have no shame in admitting

          
        I love a story thats all about flash, action and amusing characters. Thats what Cowboy Bebop is and its proof that mere storytelling is an art too. There are a few touching moments and the last episodes push for something more profound, but until then there isnt any depth. Why should it have any when Mushroom Samba is one of the best anime episodes ever?

Watanabe taglined the show as a new genre unto itself and later called it an exaggeration. Thats like the fastest runner in the world saying hes slow. Cowboy Bebop never runs out of steam or ideas. It always has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and always excited what other stories it can tell. Many of the tropes are recognizable, but nothing is a missed chance.

The approach is akin to a band that tries a new genre with every song. People who complain about the episodic nature miss the point. The series has a wider reach than nearly every anime out there. Pretty much every episode is a whole different genre. The characters and art style are the same, but even the color schemes change. Mushroom Samba and Cowboy Funk are experiments with Comedy and have brighter colors. Toys in the Attic experiments with horror and is noticeably darker.

Even pacing and side-character design changes. The aforementioned Mushroom Samba has far wackier character design than Speak Like a Child, one of the more introspective episodes. The series doesnt simply borrow a lot from Western fiction but distills it to one show. It had mass appeal because it had a wide reach  whoever you are, theres something to like her.

Convincing the viewer that the world in your anime exists is difficult. Calling things realistic or unrealistic isnt enough, since you first have to know what reality is (or, more correctly, how people perceive reality). The solid blocks dont define reality. Spaceships and cities on the moon arent automatically unrealistic. If you told people from 1000 years ago that anime will exist theyll think youre possessed by a devil.

Reality and real life go deeper than this. Reality is, among things, confusing and has a lot of sides. If it didnt we wouldnt need to create art. The most realistic anime are the most far-reaching ones. An anime is more realistic the more it can contain different moods and different people. It doesnt matter whether you live as a drifter or in a small community  life has all kinds of things going for it.

The show has bounty hunters in space, loud gunfights and a failed experiment that learned to fly. Its still more realistic  and thus more alive than most anime out there. The variety in mood and texture of the events brings it to life. I couldnt imagine a show having a fat balloon assassin feeling realistic.

The cast is also a prime example of how to have an ensemble. Spike isnt the main character. Theyre all are. Their personalities arent simply different but connected, there is chemistry here. Jet isnt just a contrast to Spikes apathy, but a more warm figure for the damaged Faye and the young Ed. Spikes apathy and cockiness is what puts him at odds with Faye but their greed is what they share and what unites them. Ed herself is a sun in the group of depressed individuals. The characters dont act out of convenience but on their inner drives, and each of their reactions is uniquely theirs.

Variety itself isnt enough, of course. You need more than the basics of having different episodes with different styles and moods. The narratives are always tightly focused. The world is full of great anime, but few deserve the award of no useless shots. Except for the plot-heavy episodes (which dont really work anyway), every shot equals progress.

Its worth noting that Cowboy Bebop isnt a dialogue-heavy show. It borrowed this from the film noire genre. Unlike noires bad side, Bebop doesnt rely on dark shots to let you things are dark. Rather, it doesnt use a lot of dialogue because it doesnt need to. The shots are informative enough, and so are never boring.

The series only flaw is the grand story behind it focusing on Spikes past. The series doesnt exactly lose focus, but confidence. Up until then the defining trait was elegance. Everything was small, but it was enough that counted for a lot. Suddenly we have this huge backstory of broken hearts and smoking guns and overthrowing a criminal syndicate. The last two episodes, while having decent actions, end up mostly as a collection of serious dialogue and dark staring. It survives only on the shows natural charm. This is one route that demanded a whole new way of storytelling. Its nice of Watanabe to try but it didnt work.

Cowboy Bebop is a great anime not because its philosophical, influential or borrows a lot from Western fiction. Its brilliant because its a masterpiece of pure storytelling. There are no useless parts in these 23 or so episodes. Each story is different both in events, pacing and mood. People who are uncomfortable with this will make stuff up about existentialism but its their loss. Regardless of who you are, theres something to enjoy here.

    There are quite a lot of anime that have a western setting, yet it is rare to see ones that contain the typical "wild west" feeling, much less portray in a convincing manner, in which viewers may associate it to adventure and mayhem, rash shootings and cowboys. While this may seem generic, Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story that came as a very pleasant surprise, as it managed to transmit magnificently such theme, with several tweaks to the setting itself. Furthermore, even when it was for the majority of the series of episodic nature, it managed to properly narrate a story with very interesting

          
        and varied episodes, whilst fleshing out its cast accordingly; which is difficult and rare in the medium.

~Story~

The story of Cowboy Bebop is centered on the members of the spaceship "The Bebop", Spike and Jet, a drifter and retired cyborg cop whose profession is bounty hunting for a living. They meet a lot of odd characters, in which Faye and Ed are one of the main highlights. As mentioned earlier, what is curious is the context of the series: it has its setting in the year 2071 in which humanity has left earth and settled themselves amongst the stars. What is more, it came together with the collapse of nations, and thus the emergence of disorder, violence, freedom and wild shootings -  it has the typical western "cowboy" feeling attached to it. It also shares it moments of comedy here and there, which are subtly and well introduced in several occasions without breaking immersion in the story.

This anime is for the major part of the series of episodic nature, yet what is remarkable is the variety within these. Each has its own unique and intriguing story, be it the virus that turn humans into monkeys, the classic parody to the Alien movie, the wacky cowboy, you name it. What further enhances the experience is the fact that each episode provides a feeling of continuity, including great world building showing the viewer how 2071 is, in addition to developing and fleshing its cast accordingly along the way. Some may argue that there are some episodes of lower quality, as it can be hit or miss, yet I found it to be in general of high quality. This doesn't mean the anime doesn't have its share of serious episodes in which actual story progression takes place regarding the characters, in particular that of Spike. These are brimming with life, action and love, giving viewers insight in the characters: it is filled with tension and intrigue. It is worth mentioning that the conclusion of the series is arguably of the most satisfying ones in the anime industry.

~Characters~

Cowboy Bebop is a character driven story, and thus the characters are of great importance to the story to make it work properly, and the anime managed to achieve this masterfully. Although the characters may be considered as stereotypes, in this case it is apparent that these can be very interesting when approached correctly. First of all, it must be mentioned that most of the characters have a mysterious background which is not apparent to viewers at first, yet as story progresses, it is slowly revealed in several bits. Ultimately, most of these are portrayed to audiences in a satisfying manner, yet not fully clarified in some cases, which is left for the viewer to imagine. This may be lacluster for some, but in this case it actually works in its favour to maintain the intrigue and splendid atmosphere of the anime.

The members of the spaceship "Bebop" are composed of intriguing and entertaining characters, almost everyone being developed and fleshed out. There is Spike, a calm and cunning, somewhat lazy guy, yet immensely likeable whose motives on staying on the ship are not quite apparent at first, yet with am intriguing past. Then there is Jet, the hard-boiled and hardworking cop, now retired from the profession for bounty hunting instead. Other character of interest is Faye Valentine, a tomboy yet cunning woman, to being at times quite arrogant; but this is all because of her brittle past, which adds to the credibility of her character. Ultimately there is Ed, a superhacker girl, an energetic careless person who acts very childishly; she seems to be there for comical relief, yet it is apparent that she is slowly developed and as well as cunning, albeit in small measures.

Other remarkable aspect of the anime are the interactions with the cast: all of the characters have such diverse personalities that is bizarre to see them all together and interact each other; what ties them together are their common goals, be it revenge, greed, profit, convenience, you name it. The relationships are slowly developed according to their personal development, which was a nice touch to the show. As for the secondary characters and "villains" if you may, these are for the majority quite interesting with sometimes motives, or intriguing past that showcase the hardships of society. Some either serve to enhance the comedy, world building, or the story plot itself.

~Animation and sound~

The animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is fantastic, even when considering in aired in the late 90's. The actions scenes, for both combat and space battles, are very fluid giving insight of the whole battle scene to the viewer. In addition, the choreography involved is detailed and feels realistic, further enhancing the experience. As for the art style itself, it is befitting of the atmosphere with very detailed backgrounds; not to mention the great usage of lighting effects to the anime that serves to intone the various atmospheres. The character designs are well done as well, varied and intriguing, matching with the corresponding personalities. However, there were times in which some backgrounds/characters were not as detailed, yet this was a small issue.

Concerning the music score, it is truly outstanding: the use of jazz, blues and classic rock may seem odd considering its setting, yet it fits magnificently with the atmosphere. Each piece is also adjusted to the various situations. The fact that there are 4 CD's with over 80 different pieces composed for the series shows the dedication the studio had for the anime. As for the voice actors, these performed their roles splendidly, matching with the different personalities and intonations used. What came to me as a surprise, is the fact that the english dub was as good (or maybe even better) to the japanese one, which is noteworthy. The openings and endings of the anime were well executed and befitting of the theme, such as Tank!, surely one of the most famous ones.

~Enjoyment~

Cowboy Bebop was overall a great anime, with fantastic characters and their respective development and fleshing out. The soundtracks used in addition to the animation enhanced the viewing experience greatly; the fact that the anime managed to convey an intriguing story despite being of episodic nature was a huge bonus as well. Some viewers may be bothered by this and find them lackluster, as it can be hit/miss for some; the fact that the story is nothing extremely grandiose can be an issue as well, yet at a personal level this was never the case. So do I recommend this anime? I wholeheartedly do to anyone of any demographic, as the characters in conjunction with the animation and sound certainly makes it almost a must watch.

    Do you miss the days where outer space felt like a place where people went to work, did their laundry and lived their average lives, instead of a futuristic, chrome-plated, automated, flashing, beeping gadget? I certainly do. Titles like Star Wars made space feel like someplace that you might live someday, instead of a place where everything was shiny and new, and nobody ever had to do manual labor. Cowboy Bebop is on to something with the way it portrays outer space. At least, thats what avid fans of the series may tell you.

Being one of the more popular anime titles out there, does it

          
        really live up to all the hype? Hopefully, this review will answer some of those questions for you. Diehard fans of the series may not like some of the things that Im about to say, just to give you fair warning.

Story (4/10)Whoa, hold on a second! Didnt you just spend the first paragraph of this review praising the anime? Yes, people who inevitably will question me, I did. However, this particular chunk of the review wont be so lavish with praise. 

Allow me to explain myself. The 4/10 makes it look like I hated this show. Let me assure you that I did not hate it.

The story of Cowboy Bebop takes place, you guessed it, sometime in the future in outer space. It follows the adventures of a bounty hunter named Spike and his buddy, Jet, a fellow bounty hunter. While this sounds like a stereotypical journey through space boredom, its actually quite refreshing. Spike and Jet live in a space world that somehow reminds you of the old west. The entire start of the story just feels organic. You get a good sense of who the two characters are, and what theyre doing.

So, why have I given the story such a low score? Well, quite simply, it was the startling lack of depth to the story that killed it for me. For the first several episodes, the show feels, wellepisodic. There isnt really a whole lot of story to connect the events of the first several episodes together. The only real common thread is Spike and Jet collecting bounty after bounty. Now, much to my surprise, this actually wasnt a bad thing at first. I can deal with a few episodes where the plot isnt apparent yet, if done well. And these episodes were! There were very good, and quite fun to watch! The atmosphere drew me in, the characters were intriguing, and the action was well-executed.

However, as any viewer will, I eventually began to get curious about the past of the characters, and how theyve come to be where they are now.  After a few episodes, you finally start to get a few painfully brief glimpses into Spikes past as he comes face to face with an old enemy. However, this tension is quickly dropped in favor of some more episodic adventures.

Fast forward another several episodes, and you get some more overarching plot involving this aforementioned villain. This particular adventure is split into two episodes, which got me very interested. However, the story drops the overall plot AGAIN and doesnt pick it back up until the final two episodes. I really am not exaggerating, folks; aside from an occasional, brief flashback, the entire plot takes place in the space of about five episodes. 

So what are the other twenty-one episodes? Well, most of the other episodes are fun little adventures that involve some new villain every time, and put the characters in some sort of funny/amusing situation. Enough for some people, perhaps, but not for me. What really hooks me into a show is good, solid, well-planned plot. And Cowboy Bebop plain and simply failed to deliver. And on top of all that, the ending iswell, to avoid spoilers, lets just say I didnt care for it.

Basically, I was sitting there frothing at the mouth, episode after episode, saying Wheres the plot? When does the plot start to form?. And then I was left with precious little plot at all, only to be disappointed by the ending. Its like if youre at a restaurant and they give you a salad, and I mean a really, REALLY delicious salad as an appetizer, but when you finish your salad and keep asking for the main course, they just give you more salad instead. Then, once youre starting to get sick of salad, they hand you a stale pop-tart as dessert and send you on your way. What? Wheres all the good stuff that I came here for?

Thats exactly how I felt at the end of Cowboy Bebop. I felt dissatisfied, and I felt like a great group of characters with good back stories, a very good atmosphere, an interesting villain, and some really solid action scenes had all simply gone to waste. I think thats why I dislike the story so much. It got my expectations so high because the first few episodes were so good, only to disappoint me in the end.

Art (10/10)See? There WERE things I liked about this show!

 Cowboy Bebop really is a gem among animation. Mind you, this anime was released in 1999, and the animation is STILL better than half of the stuff thats released today. Every motion is fluid and smooth, and I never noticed any instances where the animation was lazy, or where the creators cut corners to save time or money. What really gets me is how some objects, like spaceships, were drawn without computer animation. Most animators will use computers to animate something with many moving parts, but not Cowboy Bebop. And in the instances where computer animation is used, it often took me several times to actually notice it.

Everything about the animation in this show is superb, from the characters, to the background, to the dark color palette that makes up the show. There were times when I wanted to pause the video just so I could stop and look at all of the beautiful details in the background. All in all, the art creates a very convincing atmosphere that makes you feel like you really ARE in space with the characters. 

Sound (10/10)  I really dont think you can find an anime with a better score than this one. Im completely serious. I know that its a bold claim to make, but the music is absolutely sensational! Remember how I keep blabbing on about what great atmosphere this show has? Well, the music is largely a part of it. Tank, the opening theme, is one of the most popular opening titles in the history of anime, and nearly every other bit of music is as fun and addicting to listen to as the title. This is easily the strongest point of the show, and was a large part of what I enjoyed while watching it.

For the first time, wellever, I watched this series entirely in English. I was shocked to discover that the English dub of this show is VERY good. Ive heard rumors that the creator of the show likes the English voices better than the Japanese, but Im not certain of whether its true or not. In any case, you wont be disappointed if you watch this show in English. Ive never heard such a skilled cast of voice actors put together for any English dub, and never even once stopped and thought about the voice acting being poor. I cant speak for the Japanese voices, but Ive heard that those are quite good as well. No matter how you watch it, youre not likely to be disappointed by the voice actors.

Characters (6/10)The first rule of creating any workable story is that the characters must be believable. And, largely, the characters of this show fit that mold. In addition to Spike and Jet, there are two other members that make it onboard to become part of the crew, and although these characters spend the majority of the time being annoyed with one another, youll still find yourself liking them and laughing at their dynamic they share. Each character gets at least one episode devoted to exploring their back story, which is a significant chunk of time, considering the short length of the show. 

Thus, each character was fleshed out very well by the end of the series, and I found myself caring about each of them, even the ones who had annoyed me at first. However, by the time the plot starts to wrap up in the last two episodes, I came to realize that the relationships between the characters werent really going anywhere. One character whom didnt give a rip about Spike at the beginning, actually started to care whether he existed or not by the end. Spike doesnt seem to care at all, and what could have made for a very interesting moment between two characters was thrown out the window when Spike walked away.

I think my biggest reason for the low score was at the end, how so little emotional catharsis was achieved. Spike spends most of the series remembering a woman he loved, but the ending doesnt really do much to take care of all that pent-up emotion. Even when Spike has that inevitable facedown with the villain at the end, I still didnt feel like anything had really been achieved. Yes, I suppose the plot had technically been resolved, but what about my beloved characters? How do they react to all of this? Well, I hope you didnt care about them, because the show never tells you.

Its that stale pop-tart showing up again. Not only do you get an unsatisfactory ending plot-wise, but the show NEVER tells you what happens to the other characters! Even if they had all died, I still would at least have known what happened to them. However, the ending focuses solely on Spike, and even what happens to him leaves a little room for interpretation and guesswork. I suppose thats why I disliked the plot so much. I felt like the characters that I knew and loved werent done justice by the ending.

Enjoyment (7/10)This anime left me torn. I loved the music. I loved the art. I loved the characters. I even loved the first few episodes of the show, but I just felt like the ending let me down. Ultimately, I did enjoy the show, despite the many flaws I pointed out.

Overall (7/10)So now its time to answer the question I posed at the beginning: is this show overrated? My answer would be a tentative yes. While there are aspects of the show that I didnt care for, namely the plot, I still really enjoyed it, and the music definitely lived up to the hype.
Ultimately, Id say this show is definitely worth watching. I just feel like whenever a show gets as much hype as this one does, people are bound to be disappointed once in awhile.

    *Note just because I give it all 10s does not mean I believe that this is perfect. I just believe it is a masterpiece and I enjoyed it immensely."

The 90s were a great time for anime. There was  DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, EVA, Sailor Moon etc. all were very good shows in their own right and garnered millions of fans worldwide. I am not here to talk about those, I here to talk about Cowboy Bebop, a timeless classic which was probably the reason why many people became interested in anime. Ah, I remember staying up until midnight, waiting for Cowboy Bebop to show

          
        up on Toonami. Ah the memories...............but I digress.

Story- Now the revolves around a crew of space bounty hunters, whos main goal is to amass a large amount of money so they can live lavishly. It starts out with the main protagonist, Spike Speigel and his older buddy/pilot of their ship, Jet. Eventually, their crew expands to about 2 other people and also a dog. They go around the galaxy going on a bunch of crazy and wild adventures.

The show is episodic. It is not like one hugeeee long arc about one thing; each episode focuses on a specific adventure that the crew goes on, or them trying to deal with their past. Sometimes you will see Spike battle a fat, sociopathic killer with amazing strength, and other times you will see characters reflect upon their past as a means of catharsis. But, at the very end you will witness one of the greatest endings in anime history. Ask anyone who has seen Cowboy Bebop, they will agree.

Art- The art was very good for its time, and it even holds up well today. It is very crisp and you can tell from the detailed character drawings and ship designs. The show is also very "western," themed, as in like Cowboys from the olden days. 

Sound- The soundtrack is amazing, it is a unique blend of jazz, blues, music-box etc. It is very eclectic to say the least. It is worthy of its widespread acclaim.

Dub over sub for this one. This only do to one person, Steve Blum one of the greatest voice actors of all time. His performance as Spike is what made him what he his today.

Character- It is probably one of the more popular casts in anime. First you have Spike, cynical, sarcastic bad ass with a shady past. Next, you have Jet Black, pilot of the Bebop and a grizzled ex-police officer. Third, you have Faye, sexy, and manipulative con woman. Fourth, you have Ed, the 
androgynous, whacky computer hacker. Lastly, we have the dog Ein, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. This seemingly mis-matched group of rag tags, could not be more perfectly put together in my eyes.

Overall I give this show a 10/10  because it in all honesty it is a great show to watch. I will say that some people may find it  to be boring, so don't  watch it if you don't like shows with a focus on dialogue. This is a show that you should recommend to anime newcomers.

    Cowboy Bebop. Perhaps the greatest anime TV show created thus far. It's a massive mixture of genres, but is mostly sci-fi, comedy and action with a western vibe and a touch of film noir.

The story of Cowboy Bebop, or the lack thereof, is probably the weakest link to the series. This series does not have an ongoing story. However, the story is NOT the main focus of the show. Each episode can stand on its own.

The main focus is the immense variety of entertainment that this show provides. Many episodes are done in a different style. Some are dedicated to character development (what I call

          
        the chill-out episodes), some are dedicated to character back-story (each main character gets about 2 or 3), some are dedicated to pure action and fun, while some are psychological thrillers or even social commentary.

The second main focus is the characters. Each main character is very well developed by the end of the series. It seems that the creators found the perfect kind of characters that would compliment the crew of Bebop. And what's this perfect formula? Contrast. Each character in the crew of Bebop has a very unique personality. Putting characters that do not fit together creates very interesting and funny situations, indeed.

The music is top-notch in this show. It ranges from jazz, funk and bebop to pop, classic rock and choir singing. Very memorable and compliments the scenes well.

By the time you finish this series, you will probably remember many of the times where the crew were just hanging out, living their everyday life. I think these scenes are what make the show. It wouldn't be the same without this contrast to the action throughout the show.

Overall I give Bebop a 10 out of 10. It's extremely enjoyable; the production design is amazing, and it has lovable and memorable characters, as well as amazing music that perfectly compliments the show.

    Ok, I knew this was an episodic anime going into it. I'm not the biggest fan of those but with everything I've heard about the show and how great it is I decided to give it a go. First couple episodes were pretty good so I thought 'I can get through this.' Cut to ep. 15 and now I'm struggling to finish it. The sound and dub are amazing, I'm not denying that but the story suffers majorly here. There's no real over arcing story line other than Faye's story and Spike's and even then they are really only mentioned in the second half with

          
        everything else feeling like they're fillers. The animation was nice with it before the digitization age with it feeling dark and everything with no real noticeable flaws. 

When we first see Julia and thereafter, I couldn't of cared less about her even after everything. I knew nothing about her or anything. Spike's backstory was jammed into the last two episodes with a couple hints throughout the anime so when the final two episodes happened it just seemed out of the blue which might be why I was so annoyed at the ending. I thought that something else was going to happen and it didn't. 

I especially didn't care didn't care about Edward. When she left I couldn't help but cheer. What was the point to her character being on Bebop? I couldn't understand. Yes, she's a hacker but that's all. And the way she spoke rubbed me the wrong way and felt so childish and out of place in the show. Not to mention she wasn't there for very long so again, I wondered what her purpose there was. 

Faye was amazing. I know some people don't like her but I enjoyed her character especially after we learn parts of her backstory which made her more intriguing in my mind. Her character was consistent through the show but there was some character development which was nice (unlike Edward). I couldn't help but laugh at her and Spike going back and forth.

Jet is an interesting one because even though he owns the ship Spike seemed to be the one in charge-most of the time. Jet will put his foot down and argue if he has to. There's a few other things that I can't think of right now but suffice to say I enjoyed him.

Spike...pretty much a walking contradiction until the last couple episodes but I won't grip about that here. He can be ruthless but compassionate. He tells Faye to stop living in the past when that's all he does and so forth. 

The show down between him and Vicious felt cheap I'm not going to lie but it did. The very ending I wasn't expecting but again, I felt a but cheated with how quick everything went. If that story line was the over arcing one throughout the whole series and that finale was stretched to three episodes instead of two than I think it could have worked better and flesh out Vicious a bit more because I couldn't of care less when the fight was going on since he didn't really seem like a villain to me. Maybe it's because I didn't watch the movie but he didn't really do it for me as a bad guy. 

Overall, if you like Bebop that's good. I had trouble with it because it was so light humoured until the last couple episodes so the tone was everywhere and it was purely episodic. Not to mention some of the characters did it in for me so I can gladly say I watched it but probably won't be one I'll rewatch.

    You've got be in a certain time at a certain place to appreciate Cowboy Bepop. It's sense of cultural mismatch doesn't excuse it's lack of identity. It pushes style over substance because there is no substance. It's constant homage to everything and anything muddies whatever originality it has.

But at the same time, cowboys in space sounds cool right? Freeform jazz is cool too. Martial arts are cool. Are these the reasons the anime became so famous? Or is it because the 90s meant it had to be viewed on television at whatever time the channels chose to air Japanese cartoons, meaning that the sense of

          
        disconnect was covered up by genuine disconnection? Is it because it was the only good looking anime that could be watched - in English - without cringing?

Perhaps it's my fault I didn't like Cowboy Bepop. Maybe it's because I chose to marathon it, going 3-4 episodes a day? Maybe it's because it's old? Maybe I'm simply not the target audience? During the duration I gave Cowboy Bebop, I was constantly trying to puzzle together why I didn't like it. Maybe it'll get better, I figured.

The thing is that any logical conclusion I could think of didn't make sense. Other 90s anime include some of my all time favourites like Neon Genesis, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Serial Experiments Lain, so it's definitely not my lack of tolerance towards it's age. I've marathoned tons of shows, and if anything, that tends to make me enjoy them more. I love sci-fi.

When I finally came to my senses, I finally rejected the idea that Cowboy Bepop is good. I accepted my own opinion, piercing through the thick armour of everybody else's, fuelled by rampant nostalgia and shielded by being overly sympathetic to the show's age.

With most (x)-of-the-week shows, you figure out quite quickly whether you'll like them or not based on 1 or 2 episodes. I liked Bepop at first, I loved it's sense of style, with a Blade-Runner-like noir universe and fun jazz. But every episode had exactly the same format, with no connections between episode - no hook to make me care. The 20 minute runtime of the show meant that they nose-dived into introducing whoever they chase, they chase them and then they get paid. The action sequences were so drawn out that there wasn't any time for fickle character development or an underlying plot. 

Every single list discussing the best characters in anime includes one or two of these characters. After 16 or so mundane episodes, I just couldn't figure this one out. They're bland. Their interactions are cold and sterile with little chemistry. A sense of family was forced upon you, but it only served to remind how stereotypical and cliche Jet's caring side is. Faye's design makes her nothing more than sci-fi modified fanservice, and her character has very little going on inside. Ed is annoying.

And then we come to Spike, who serves as the show's hero. He's a generic Marty Stu, who's too cool to care about. 

Cowboy Bepop amazes me, it really does. The aura of perfection is has, built solely on fond memories of small TVs and awkward schedules, is impressive. But if you take it out of context, the facade falls down. Cowboy Bepop is weekly trash and nothing more.

    As an avid movie watcher and music lover, Cowboy Bebop was the first anime I've ever seen, with the perspective that I was about to see an anime. Of course, before this experience, I had already watched stuff like Dragon Ball or Doraemon, but those don't really count, because I never really watched them from a critical and artistic point of view. From the time I first finished Cowboy Bebop, I've watched several other anime and even rewatched Cowboy Bebop a second time. Because Cowboy Bebop is so special, both on a personal level and as an anime, I will be using an unconventional order

          
        to review it.


----- Soundtrack (10) -----

I've heard many skeptics say to me that Cowboy Bebop is a silly name for a show, and that it drives them away from watching it. I completely disagree with these opinions, as I think the name Cowboy Bebop is the perfect name in regards to the show's soundtrack. If you heard a fragment of the soundtrack, you'll probably know what I am talking about. The bebop part emphasizes the jazzy influences of this amazing soundtrack (Bebop is a style or variation of jazz), Cowboy epitomizes all the adventures that this musical masterpiece will bring you.

With over 6 hours of absolutely splendid tracks, if you truly enjoy music, you'll be sure to never forget this soundtrack. Tracks like Spokey Dokey, Space Lion, Waltz for Zizi or Farewell Blues are some of the absolute masterpieces to be found among the rest of the equally excellent songs.

The true motivation for me to watch Cowboy Bebop was the grand opening, Tank. Some years ago, Cowboy Bebop was running on my television and from time to time I would listen to the mystical theme song, that wouldn't leave my mind for a long time. This truly inspired me to delve into the world of anime.

I have yet to find a soundtrack as influential and as inspiring as Cowboy Bebop's. No movie, series or anime will provide you with such an outstanding selection of songs. Even if you haven't watched Cowboy Bebop yet, I strongly recommend that you explored the music behind it, even though all of these songs become much more meaningful if you actually watch Cowboy Bebop.


----- Animation (9) -----

In my opinion, this is the only aspect of Cowboy Bebop that is not flawless. This, of course, doesn't remove the fact, that the art department of Cowboy Bebop is still very good, considering its age and the fact the it is mostly hand drawn. Having this in mind, everything looks damn good. However, some of the CGI didn't age very well (even though it is good CGI for the era) and some of the secondary characters could have been given a better look to match their great persona. This isn't the rule, and it certainly doesn't affect the show overall, but it does happen one or two times (Udai Taxim, I am looking at you).

One of the things I've liked about Cowboy Bebop was the fights. You rarely get lost in the action like many shows and they are usually smoothly animated and very enjoyable.

All in all, Cowboy Bebop looks pretty darn good and its visuals certainly match the rest of the theme going on.


----- Story (10) -----

The story of Cowboy Bebop is not an easy one to explain to people who have never seen it. This is mostly because Cowboy Bebop presents a multitude of small stories that build the individual stories of Cowboy Bebop's main characters. It is common for the people who haven't watched Cowboy Bebop to think the show is about some western showdown, but this certainly is not the case. To clear any misconceptions, our main cast consists of bounty hunters and not cowboys. The only true cowboy is Andy, a character who appears late on the show.

I would like to sum up some of the aspects explored in Cowboy Bebop:

1 - The entirety of the series happens in the future at our solar system. One of the fascinating things about Cowboy Bebop is how much our solar system has changed and how you would think human's old habits would be extinct after evolving into a interplanetary civilization. Cowboy Bebop is the story of an expanding and never learning human society.

2 - Cowboy Bebop follows the adventures of a crew of struggling bounty hunters. They are bounty hunters by chance and not choice as you will quickly learn. Together they roam our solar system in hopes of cashing bounties. Cowboy Bebop is the story of The Bebop spaceship.

3 - There is a man merely living a dream. Cowboy Bebop is the story of a man trying to wake up from that dream and get the life he once promised to himself.

I could go on and on writing about all of these things happening on Cowboy Bebop's universe, but these are just some of the more relevant ones.

Lastly, I'd like to add the amazing endings that of most of the episodes have. One could easily compare the format of Cowboy Bebop to that of short stories. A typical episode builds up to great climax and resolution, with lyrical prowess.

Everything in Cowboy Bebop is there for a reason. All the dialogues are meaningful, everything has its place and symbolic reason. The best way to describe Cowboy Bebop is that it is a truly amazing and artistic adventure.


----- Characters (10) -----

I could go on and speak about the characteristics of the main characters, but that really isn't necessary, because as soon as you start watching Cowboy Bebop you understand what they are all about. What really matters is why they act the way they do. What motivates their actions? Why did they end up being bounty hunters? These are questions that are covered perfectly, to say the least. I think one of the best experiences of Cowboy Bebop is you getting to know the crew and not having other people present them to you, so I won't write about these characters, as I think getting to know them is part of the magic of Cowboy Bebop. However, I should praise the supporting cast of Cowboy Bebop. Even though most of the supporting cast rotates and ends up making only one appearance, it is truly amazing how much depth and personality that these characters have. Hell, even the Big Shot presenters are really nice characters!

Funnily, when I discuss Cowboy Bebop with other people, I always get a different answer in regards to who their favorite characters were. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few shows that can achieve this sort of phenomenon and I can safely say that it will provide you with some of the best characters in any art media.


----- Enjoyment/Last Thoughts (10) -----

If you couldn't already tell, I really enjoyed Cowboy Bebop. It was a completely refreshing experience for me, as someone who was used to watch a lot of movies. As many have said it before, there is always something to be enjoyed by everyone in Cowboy Bebop. Even if you don't enjoy it as much as I did, I am sure you will at least like Cowboy Bebop, unless you are completely insensitive to art, because that is what Cowboy Bebop is - a masterpiece.

What I am about to say is a bit harsh, but it is true. I respect a lot of opinions, but one that I can't respect at all is that Cowboy Bebop isn't good or that they didn't like it. People who present you with this opinion are not only insulting their own intellect, but also probably didn't watch the entirety of Cowboy Bebop or didn't understand (which isn't hard) what Cowboy Bebop is about. If those aren't the answers you are probably talking to a very shallow and intellectually lacking person, but then again, these people should never be given your friendship. Yes, this is how much Cowboy Bebop means to me and to a lot of people. This is how good Cowboy Bebop is.


----- Should you watch it? -----

Absolutely. However, you need to take an artistic approach to the series, as, unlike many other popular anime, Cowboy Bebop is not completely linear and it provides a more balanced experience of action and story development.

    This is the quintessential anime. Yes, you heard it. The perfection in every way.
A one time in a lifespan journey. A diamond in the anime world. A chest full of gold buried in a very deep hole that everyone forgot about. This is Cowboy Bebop.

By the year of 2014, many people would rather watch One Piece or SAO or whatever they watch thats new, instead of watching Cowboy Bebop since its outdated to say the least. It doesn't have a sharp animation and the drawing is no way near what it is today. Well, if you think like this, then fuck you. You don't deserve

          
        to experience what this masterpiece has to offer. The other ones who can get past its look, be sure that the reward is higher than that.

Cowboy Bebop doesn't follow a typical story, which only adds to its uniqueness. Its episodic and that means every episode = a new story to be told in this MASSIVE universe. Its strange how no one wants to do another series in this universe, not following the past characters. But i can understand that, because no one will repeat the succes of what Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno did. Nonetheless, every episode is interesting and i wasn't bored a single time.

The Art is amazing, but i can see that someone will not like it. Well, good then.  The future is still very believable and i'd rather have this future than Star Wars and such.

The Sound is as good as it gets. Seriously. No other anime has what CB has packed in 4 discs i believe. The Jazz... enough words.

The Characters deserve a special spot in my soul. I will always remember the charming Spike, experienced Jet, lost Faye and crazy Ed.

This is without a question, the best anime out there. Go watch it right now. You can thank me later.

    Imagine Bruce Lee and Quentin Taratino's love child grew up and decided to make an anime after viciously fighting tigers in a jungle with nothing but a sharp stick. Ladies and gentlemen, that anime would be Cowboy Bebop. I often view Cowboy Bebop as the "devil" of anime. Not because it's particularly bad, but in fact it's quite the contrary. When you sign a deal with the devil, what happens? You get what you want, and the devil gets your soul. And in this case, you get the best entertainment you'll ever have in your life, but your soul is now being vastly devoured by

          
        anime shows. 

Story: 9/10 - Cowboy Bebop is a bit different than other anime because it's plot vastly depends on the episodes (rather than it being a continuous plot throughout the series), to the point where it kinda mirrors a lot of American cartoons in it's story telling format. However, I still do HIGHLY recommend you watch all the episodes. Not only are all of them tremendously entertaining, but a lot of elements from certain episodes come back later as important plot. The overarching plot is pretty simple, the show follows two partners: Spike and Jet who've had rough pasts and run off to become space bounty hunters in a future society where inter-planetary travel isn't just possible, but also widely used. Overtime there spaceship (the Bebop) gains more and more members: A women with and attitude (Faye), a corgi with enhanced intelligence (Ein), and a superhacker (Who is just a little girl with SEVERE ADHD named Edward). 

Art: 10/10 - The art itself especially deserves praise because Cowboy Bebop came out before digital animation was widely used... and it's STILL better animated than a hell of a lot of modern anime. The fight scenes are still very fluid for it's time and still holds up to the very day. 

Sound: 10/10 - Want to hear the best fucking dub in existence? Look no further than Cowboy Bebop. This show has vastly been considered to have the best dub in anime history, and it came out an era where not much was expected in the dubbing process. As for the soundtrack? Well, Cowboy Bebop relies heavily on it's music as it's loaded with jazz/blues. And if you're a music fan this anime is LOADED with classic rock references... try and see if you can guess them all. 

Character: 9/10 - All the main characters that I listed above were all very dynamic and lovable in their own right, but my one and only problem with the characters are the side characters. A lot of times you'll get a very interesting side character who only gets 20 minutes of screen time, and you'll never see him/her... again. However, ALL the main characters are amazing in every way, shape, and form. Spike and Jet are total bad-asses, Faye makes a great seductress for the show (and has a very interesting back story), and Edward is one of the greatest comic reliefs in anime history. Not to mention fucking Vicious, the main antagonist of the show who trained beside Spike. 

Enjoyment: 10/10 - One of the many things that makes Cowboy Bebop so interesting is the fact they are willing to laugh at subjects that most anime wouldn't DARE to touch. Drugs (The Shroom episode... oh god the shroom episode), sex, transvestites, gruesome murders, gambling, and humans who have been heavily experimented on... this anime has 'em all! There is no such thing as limits when it comes to this show, because limits are for pussies! I personally found every single episodes filled with entertainment that had me hooked from start to finish.

This show is not called a classic because it's made in the late 90's, it's called a classic because it fucking deserves the title. If you are looking for a show that steps beyond the boundaries of other anime, and a show where just watching it will cause your chest hair to grow by about 3 inches, than Cowboy Bebop is the show for you! Overall: 9.5/10

    Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile and writing these exact words:

"Fuck you! Cowboy Bebop is a classic! You're not allowed to

          
        criticize it!"

The more astute viewers will note that I scored the series a 6, but the movie a 9. I kind of like Cowboy Bebop. It does do some things very right. It had the potential to be one of the greatest franchises ever. Alas, while its production values are unmatched, the writing . . . doesn't always match up with the production. Because of this, the series ended up being a style-over-substance experience for me, but why was that?

The premise of CB is that in the late 21st century, mankind has started living in places in the solar system besides Earth. In this future are bounty hunters known as Cowboys. Cowboys do whatever they can to make cash to keep the food stockpile stocked and their spaceships running. The show follows one such group of Cowboys who pilot a ship called the Bebop. In the beginning, we meet Spike Spiegel, a former gangster, and Jet Black, a former cop. As the series progresses, the Bebop also has Ein, a super smart dog, Faye Valentine, a woman on the run, and Edward, a really, really, REALLY weird hacker girl. Cowboy Bebop has been described as a series that has a continuous plot, and has standalone episodes at the same time. Having seen the series, I can tell you that technically, most of the episodes aren't standalone, but many of them are only connected by the core characters.

Here's where one of my problems lie. When Cowboy Bebop is good, it's really good. The setting is very mature; it never condescends to the audience. The action scenes are superbly well done, the dialog is believable (though cheesy at times), and the atmosphere really pulls you in. How many episodes are actually really good? Seven. If you count the movie as an episode, that brings it up to eight. Eight out of twenty-seven episodes were good. The rest were not.

The problem with most of the episodes is one of two things: one, it's really boring, or, two, it's so clichd, you will be able to predict exactly what happens by the end after the first two minutes, or both. I have to be honest, a lot of the episodes of CB are just plain boring. If this wasn't a "classic" and a more ordinary anime series, a lot of them would be branded as what they truly are; filler episodes. And if it's not boring filler, it's hackneyed.

Watanabe is known for being a huge fan of American cinema, and that's obvious in CB. Unfortunately, he ripped off a lot of American movies virtually piecemeal. Now, you may not suspect it, but I am more knowledgeable of American cinema than I am Japanese animation. To describe it as best I can without spoiling, if you have seen at least one movie directed by Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, John Woo, and Michael Mann, then you have already seen Cowboy Bebop in another format. This is actually a clever trick though; most anime fans reject Western pop culture, and may not notice this when watching CB, so they'll think it's "fresh" and "original", when it's fact, it's actually MORE clichd then most anime. But hey, when CB is exciting and isn't (too) blatantly ripping off Hollywood, it's worth watching.

At least, when the worthwhile characters are onscreen. I like the main character Spike a lot. He is the embodiment of cool, like a 21st century version of Steve McQueen. He's cool, but he's very human too. He's reckless, he makes mistakes, but he knows how to charm people, and he also knows how to beat his targets. I also like Jet. He's a constant worrywart, which is a funny contrast to his rough appearance. Some of the incidental characters are memorable too, (but usually only in the good episodes and movie). Something else I liked was the Bebop crew was not always a stable group, or nakama you could say. In most anime, when the heroes band together, nothing ever separates them. That doesn't happen in CB. Sometimes, the crew gets in arguments, and sometimes, one of them will leave the Bebop for a time, and so on. It's a touch of realism I appreciate.

However, some of the characters didn't click with me. I never really cared for Faye. I don't dislike her, but I don't really care for her either. Edward is amusing, but she feels out of place in a series like this. The incidental characters in the less memorable episodes are just that, unmemorable. However, what I'm about to print in the next paragraph will anger thousands, possibly millions. (And maybe make hundreds say "Right on!") Mind you, it's just my opinion. Everything I print in these reviews is just my opinion; you don't have to take it personally, but the following opinion of mine needs to be said:

Vicious is one of the lamest villains ever.

The main antagonist is a man known as Vicious, someone who's still a part of the gang Spike came from. He's cunning, ruthless . . . and is absolutely lame. What's his motive? Does he just want power, or to mess with people? Even if so, why is he so boring to watch? The villain from the movie was a lot more interesting. Overall, you got two really good protagonists, some interesting chemistry between the protagonists, one-shot characters who are either interesting or not, and a forgettable antagonist. Yay.

And I haven't even touched upon the ending yet! Short version, I don't like CB's ending. (More flames incoming! Duck and cover!) Now, the ending is not quite as bad as the ending for, say, Akira, or the anime version of Chobits. It does have a sense of finality to it, something most anime endings don't have. However, I did not find it "legendary." I found it disappointing. First of all, the ending is extremely predictable. It's virtually telegraphed to you before it even happens. Not only that, when I saw it, my reaction was, " . . . that's it? Seriously, that's IT?"

But I better move on to CB's technical aspects before I get too letdown. Its artistry leaves no complaints. CB is probably the best-looking pre-digital anime I've ever seen. Even if you were to remake the series with digital enhancements, I doubt you could make it look better than it already is. Sumptuous backgrounds, top-notch character art, animation that ranges from above-average to really good, no off-model shots, this is a visual feast. The movie looks even better. It's obvious a lot of care was put into the visuals of CB. My only being the primitive CGI, but you get used to it.

And now we touch upon CB's greatest aspect; its soundtrack. It's the sort of the soundtrack that makes you go, "Ah yeah, baby!" This is why you watch CB, the music. The music is the magnum opus of Yoko Kanno. A combination of jazz, blues, and rock, but it isn't just any old jazz, blues, and rock, it's GOOD jazz, blues, and rock. Everything from the opening, to the incidental music, to the endings, you get music that will set your soul on fire. The only anime I've seen whose soundtrack could rival CB's is Death Note's. Something I noticed about CB's soundtrack is the music sounds more like music from albums rather than typical soundtrack music. Another smart move; most people are accustomed to listening to music from CD and MP3 albums as opposed to soundtracks, so when they hear CB's music, it'll be more familiar-sounding than most other anime soundtracks. Regardless, even if you hate CB, you gotta score this music.

CB is also famous for having what is perhaps the oldest English dub for an anime series that is considered god-like. I saw this on Adult Swim, and I can safely say, this is another masterpiece from Bandai and Bang Zoom. Every character sounds like how you would imagine them to, and the voices are neither wooden nor over-acted. All the different accents the characters have sound really cool too. I did sample the Japanese dub on the movie, and I will say, Spike and Jet sound really good in both Japanese and English, but I will never get used to Faye's Japanese voice. Yeah, this is one you gotta see in English. (Though in retrospect, the Japanese performances aren't bad, it just doesn't click like the English dub)

While CB is still often regarded as a classic, I'm not the first to criticize it like so. There has been some backlash against CB in recent years. Some people complain it's not "Japanese-y" enough, that it's too Western. I mentioned that earlier, but there is another anime I've seen, Baccano, which is also very similar to American movies, but it was consistently entertaining, and not as predictable as CB, so I did not mind. Others have mentioned the same things I have, that it's boring, the plot isn't strong enough, it's style over substance. This isn't a disaster by any means, but I do have to say that, outside of the production values, CB is one of the most overrated anime I've seen. It's not one of the worst, certainly not, but it's not quite the experience I was promised either. To put it in other words, there were some episodes that I would score a 4 out of 10. And yet, there are some episodes, including the movie, that I would score a 9 out of 10. The 6 overall is just from mixing the good episodes with the bad.

I like to imagine that in an alternate dimension, CB was an OVA series instead of a tv series. All the episodes I do like, (# 2, 8, 12, 13, 17, 20, and 22) were released on separate OVAs, as well as a few others to bridge the plot gaps. Then a theatrical came out (Knocking on Heaven's Door), and then another to end it all (The Real Folk Blues, albeit with a revised conclusion), and it would be grandiose. Alas, I don't live in that universe. Hey, Shinichiro Watanabe likes drawing influence from Hollywood, right? What's something it's doing a lot of right now? Continuity reboots? He could still do that. I can dream, can't I?

    Cowboy Bebop was not the first anime I had ever watched, which looking back probably hurt my enjoyment of the series. I had been spoiled with other action/drama series that had a much better flow to the overall story, Trigun being a prime example. Cowboy Bebop for the most part scatters plot important episodes around the series, most others being ether filler or character focused. Now I'm not complaining about filler episodes, I to a certain extent I love them since they can take more liberties to be unique in various ways. My gripe is with character-focused episodes, because they're so boring I had to

          
        attempt to watch a few of them more than once not having the care to finish it the first time. The problem is that these episodes are slow, usually take up most of the screen time with just a single main character, and have an addiction to flashbacks / somber moments. It's not the worlds biggest problem, there are only about 5 episodes like this, and 2 others that are debatably so it's not a capital offence.

I mostly only have good things left to say about the show, and if you've heard anything about it you already know what I'm going to say. The animation is exceedingly good, hand drawn and beautiful. The jazz soundtrack is iconic and is frequently compared to others that are like it. Most of the characters are memorable and interesting (excluding Ed, I have zero clue why people like her).

As a closing I'll give both a compliment and a criticism. I really liked episodes that kept the amount of science fiction elements to a minimum, not talking about space ship type stuff, I mean uploading souls to the internet. The show is at it's best when it keeps it's noir feel and collapses when it goes Star Trek. Most episodes sticks to the noir, but every once in a while you feel like you put on the wrong series.

    Actually, its a very long and dramatic story,  Jet Black (Episode 23)

	I dont think there has been a stronger unity between a series and its protagonist than the dramatic 26-episode story of Cowboy Bebop and Spike Spiegel, a series that is exactly like its protagonist and a protagonist that is exactly like its series. For example, Goku was the ideal fit for Dragon Ball Z, a powerful young man known for screaming while in combat and (on a lesser note) for not being there when hes needed the most; the series is also known for the same two things, the second one being that

          
        the series lacks in plot and characterization when it needs it the most. Another example I have is Master Keaton and the titular character of that series, Taichi Keaton. Taichi is a man who should be interesting due to him being a man of many occupations but he comes across as boring just like how the series itself should be interesting due to it being a Naoki Urasawa work but it also comes across as boring. However, I think no protagonist is more suited to a series than Spike Spiegel is to Cowboy Bebop. Spike is a bounty hinter with a past as a former gangster, a native of Mars always hungry for some quick cash. With his wispy dark green Afro and a cigarette in his mouth, Spike journeys from planet to planet in a stylish red fighter plane searching for criminals to apprehend. In the beginning of Cowboy Bebop, Spike was simply a rambunctious young man with dislikes galore and an unceasingly stubborn attitude. Throughout the series, my appreciation for our hard-smoking protagonist grew as Spike became someone who easily flowed between exuding laid-back charm and rugged intensity, as someone who matured to appreciate what he once disliked (kids, dogs, and women with attitude), and as someone who alternated between simple methods and extravagant approaches to solve problems. Actor Steve Blum knows, above all else, how to make a character interesting and Blum was at his all-time best in his role as Bebops beloved bounty hunter. Spike Spiegel, the space cowboy that the series consistently references, dominated every scene of Cowboy Bebop from the first (a black-and-white shootout) to the last (where Spike spoke one final word, fueling memories of Citizen Kane).

They are sick and tired of conventional, fixed style jazz,  Words in Theme Song

Jazz is the definitive sound of Cowboy Bebop, a genre of music closely associated with the word cool, and the jazzy songs in Bebop are far from one-dimensional, the songs a passion-filled combination of fast-paced and slow. Bebops soundtrack not only contains jazz; theres also western-themed tracks, hard rock, hypnotic blues, soft rock with English lyrics (extremely rare in anime), and even some bongo beats. At one point, Cowboy Bebop ventures into the classical genre at one point by sampling a famous piece (Tchaikovskys Waltz of the Flowers in episode 11). The two things I love most about Bebops soundtrack are the theme song and the ending theme. The Real Folk Blues has the enviable honor of being Bebops ending theme, a soulful soft rock song accompanied by a collection of grainy black-and-white images (My favorite part of the ending theme is when the singer says The re-al FOLK! Blues Powerful stuff, man). If youre reading this review, I know youve heard Bebops legendary theme song already, an intense, fast-paced jazzy track with a blues guitar in the beginning and a hyperactive horn near the end. Of course, theres more to Cowboy Bebop than the theme song but man, what a theme song it is!

Dont leave things in the fridge,  Spike Spiegel (Episode 11)

The four main characters dont merely leave their pasts in the fridge; they allow it to linger until it comes back to bite them. Jet Black is an ex-cop/bounty hunter and the pilot/mechanic of the ship Bebop, a gruff Russian cook with a soft spot. I think actress Wendee Lee delivered a much better performance as Bebop member Faye Valentine, a cigarette-smoking enigma with a gambling addiction, than she ever did as the soft-spoken voice of Azusa Fuyutsuki in Great Teacher Onizuka (Fayes first scene in Cowboy Bebop is simply unbelievable). As much as I like Spike, Jet, and Faye, my favorite character in the series has to be the one and only Edward Wong Hau Pepulu Tivrusky the Fourth (Edward or Ed for short), a skinny red-headed adolescent girl who specializes in computer hacking, talks in the third person, and injects a unique enthusiasm into every scene shes in. Throughout the series, a plethora of supporting characters are brought to the fold, from a talking computer program to a homely, rock-loving trucker (The most interesting of these are a trio of elderly Hispanic bickerers that show up in the series again and again). There are also characters in Cowboy Bebop that only appear for one episode but receive more depth than characters in different series earn in a season, like the eccentric cowboy Andy, Mad Pierrot the flying psychopath, Wen the immortal harmonica player (the spiritual predecessor to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhoods Pride), and Elisa, Jets former girlfriend. Cowboy Bebop is so phenomenal a series that even characters that dont amount to much end up being celebrated as classic examples of characterization. Of course, Im talking about Bebops main antagonist Vicious, a white-haired swordsman who never really stood out to me besides having a creepy voice. Other than Vicious, Bebops characters are well-acted, complex, and (above all) interesting.

You could argue that Cowboy Bebop isnt a great series because of its overly episodic plot, the unresolved issues of some of the side stories, and its lack of a legitimately great villain. These are all good points to use in an argument but Id have two words for you: screw you. Cowboy Bebop is the rare anime series that combines multiple genres into one: mystery, space western, film noir, comedy, blaxploitation, action, philosophical drama, pulp fiction, and even horror (only in episode 20). Every great series has classic scenes but very few series contain scenes as poignant as the ones in Cowboy Bebop; theres the Cathedral Fall Scene (where images of Spikes past are revealed with beautifully creepy singing), the Hidden Film Scene (where a younger version of a certain character encourages the viewer in whats easily the most heartbreaking scene of Bebop), and the Final Fight scene (where Spike finally confronts his past by blowing away his enemies in dramatic fashion), these three scenes distinguishing themselves from the others. Even the episode previews are great, from Spikes hilarious rant in the episode 6 preview to Jets critical review in the episode 18 preview, from Fayes glorifying speech about love in the episode 15 preview (much to Spike and Jets displeasure) to Mad Pierrots unforgettable laughing in the episode 20 preview, and (my personal favorite) Edwards announcement that the series is over during the episode 12 preview. While watching this series, the one thing that confused me the most was the issue of the characters running in motion during the theme song. Why are they doing this? I asked myself. Then I figured, Maybe they too are trying to watch Cowboy Bebop.

    Even back in my high school years, when I used to catch a random episode of Cowboy Bebop on Adult Swim, and I would be thoroughly entertained.

Now, as an adult, I have come to appreciate this anime even more. Cowboy Bebop is not an anime that follows today's "Let's make everyone pretty, and kill a dramatic scene by throwing an iron pan at someone's head". Cowboy Bebop, to me, is the essence of what a great anime is.

Even though the show's main storyline is only truly there through a small handful of episodes, each episode leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained. Each character gets their moment

          
        in the sun, so to speak, with some intriguing info on their backstory (usually in the form of an episode) that left me completely glued to the screen.

Awesome soundtrack (I still have it on my playlist to this day) , paired with great characters and well written episode to episode stories, leave the viewer wishing more anime out there did the same thing.

I found it shocking that this anime was not listed in the top 3. Cowboy Bebop still has great rewatch value for me (maybe every couples years or so, but it's there) . Drama, Comedy, Action, all perfected.  I feel this anime definitely deserves to be listed in the greatest anime of all time.

    Shinichir Watanabe's badass space western Cowboy Bebop prepares viewers for an exciting adventure of the galaxy's hottest new frontiersmen. As an intricately crafted composition of natural characters, passionate music, dark tones, and relatable themes, this epic stands the test of time as one of Japanese animation's finest masterpieces.

Story (read the synopsis first!)

Structurally, episodes, throughout the series and hereafter referred to as "sessions", focus on isolated events, pertaining either to a particular bounty, backstory, or random "filler" event. Fans of stories that are less structured and more character oriented will be satisfied in that sense, as the main plot of Spike's conflict with crime lord Vicious

          
        and the Red Dragon crime syndicate appears in tight bursts throughout the series. However, despite the disjointed pattern, the series flows in a way that leaves the viewer feeling satisfied and never disconnected from any particular character.

A welcome positive of the writing is the no-holds-barred attitude the writers take in regards to the plot. The world of Bebop is a harsh, unforgiving world, and even down to the gritty end we find that no single character is safe. Though at times you may feel emotionally pained over a decision they made, in the end you'll understand it was the right one to make.

Despite most episodes being good fun, Cowboy Bebop thematically provides a strong insight into the nature of isolation, purpose of existence, and consequences of the past. Spike is the principal instrument used by writers to convey thematic discourse, though mirrors of this behavior is seen in equally troubled partners Faye and Jet as well. Without spoiling too much, know that you'll view the deeply human struggles of the protagonists (and antagonists) with an air of familiarity and understanding.

Genre and Characteristics

Now, we can't be having "cowboys" and "bounties" without a little action, can we? Cowboy Bebop is a western by design, and with that comes adventure, hardship, and yes, fighting. Between hand-to-hand combat, bar fights, cosmic dogfighting, and katanas (yes, fucking katanas), a viewer's bloodlust will consistently be sated through the variety of action scenes present. Honestly, for the time in which this series was released, you'll be thoroughly impressed by how awesome everything looks.

As the series is set in a futuristic version of today's galaxy, science fiction plays an integral part in world development. Spaceships and hyperspace gateways replace most of today's logistics of automobiles and highways. Earth has been made mostly inhabitable, and as a result, humans live mostly on other planets in the solar system (notably Mars). Each planet retains its own personality and atmosphere, shown vibrantly through the respective color palettes, architecture, and populations. Multi-culturalism is heavily prevalent throughout the locales, with regions mimicking that of Tijuana, New York, or Beijing. Telebroadcasts are often noted as being available in multiple languages, leading us to believe there is a sense of globalism and unity throughout the galaxy. Watanabe's colonized galaxy certainly does create an interesting perspective of what the future for humanity may be like.

Animation

Surprisingly enough, Cowboy Bebop retains animation quality advanced for its time. Watanabe and Sunrise Studios overall proved themselves throughout as being able to maintain a high standard of quality. There's a certain amount of fluidity present within most motions, and characters react naturally and often under a given circumstance.

I found myself constantly in awe with was how stellar (no pun intended) the cinematography was throughout the anime. Watanabe understood how vital camera shots were to conveying what was to be expressed. When new locales are introduced, there was a frequent use of panning long shots to convey the relative size of the world. A juxtaposition is formed between the characters and the world, showing how insignificant humanity is to the greater above, tying in well with the thematic tone of the anime. Atmosphere is never in question with how masterfully each one is produced. Color tones, camera angles, and character placement all help to convey the intended feeling of a shot.

One of the common "sins" found within anime is that the "show, don't tell" rule is often disregarded in favor of a dialogue driven exposition. The latter is true for Cowboy Bebop, as we learn of the lore of the future galaxy through visually seeing it. For example, despite being a civilization that has managed space travel, there are still many pockets of poverty present as evident in many episodes. Spike's mysterious past is never spoken out in detail, rather throw short, ambiguous flashbacks that form the pieces to a greater puzzle. There's a certain degree of interactivity present that gives the viewer a stronger connection than had he or she just been explicitly lectured.

Sound

I can't think of very many other titles, save maybe for the cousin of Samurai Champloo, that have soundtracks as distinctly stylized as Cowboy Bebop's. Loyal to the name, jazz is the specific theme that composer Yoko Kanno intended for the series, and it's a theme that fits well. The spirit of expression, improvisation, passion, and divergence is indeed the character of Cowboy Bebop. Kanno masterfully utilized the tracks at fitting times throughout the series, greatly emphasizing the intended tone of a scene. One of the greatest analogies I can think of would be how well Susumu Hirasawa organized the abstract composition for Berserk ('97-98).

The voice acting, as is to be expected with such a critically acclaimed series, is fantastic. Cowboy Bebop is one of the few animes that can proudly say it has a dubbed version, so it is the viewers choice which version they'd like to hear. Personally, though this may conflict with most western enthusiasts, I prefer the Japanese voice actors.

Both the opening and ending tracks, "Tank!" and "The Real Folk Blues", respectively, are my all-time favorites. Kanno knew well how to begin and end the series, as the former gets you hyped up to all hell and the latter leaves you a pensive, emotional wreck. Ready yourself.

Characters

If the world is the framework, the soundtrack the soul, and the animation the paint, Bebop's characters must be the muse. Cowboy Bebop is uniquely designed in that the story forms around the characters rather than the opposite. A certain amount of incredulity is eliminated when characters are written so well they speak as normal people. Watanabe didn't want to spin a tale, rather relay an epic of five adventurers.

To that end, we don't see the crew as tools of a story, rather a group of friends that could be considered a family (albeit fairly dysfunctional). Spike is our flawed but lovable antihero, Jet his hardworking, moralistic foil. Faye the seductive femme fatale with a tendency for certain vices. Edward is our eccentric but useful hacker, and Ein the intelligent pupper. They're a ragtag bunch, but damn it, they work well together, and you grow to love them with each session.

Needless to say, Cowboy Bebop was a wild ride. Session after sessions, my satisfaction never wavered. There's a certain richness to this series that gets you drunk off it, always lusting for another bounty.

Part of what made the show so fun for me was its westernized tone. While in Japan this may have been seen as foreign and intriguing, for those of us in the West, we see this as familiar and welcoming. Cowboys are kind of our thing, you know? Seeing a skillfully written Japanese perspective on what entails a "space cowboy" presents a fun experience for us western folk. It's funny how on both sides of the coin it can be a positive.

Conclusion

The things that come to mind when I recall this anime come easily: cigarettes, smirks,  and woolongs. Funny how the slightest things can leave the biggest imprints, but that's exactly the intended effect. Be it the down-to-earth characters, comprehensive universe, or passionate scoring, the "new genre itself" Cowboy Bebop never leaves your heart. Even fifty-four years from now, no matter what new series are critically acclaimed, people will come back to and relive the experiences of that work with the same spark of excitement and adventure they once beared. We've all got a little space cowboy in us.

    The short ass review:
I love this show. 10/10

The actual review: 
I love me some 90's anime, its quite good. I could go on for ages on how much I goddamn love this show. I could be a grown ass man by the time I'm done. But instead, I'll give a short 5 paragraph version of why I love this show.

Cowboy Bebop takes place in space with 2 bounty hunters (Spike & Jet) making cash off killing people. Later on they find a bad-ass women (Faye), a person who still after 17 years, nobody has any idea of it's sex (Edward) and a goddamn dog. We're

          
        given enough information to work with for these characters as we meet them. It's not too much nor too little. As the show goes on, we delve deeper and deeper into the characters as we learn about their pasts. And that's really what the show revolves around, the history of a bounty hunter (Spike Spiegel) who has done a lot of bad shit which I won't talk about cause duh, spoilers. But it is real emotional. It even gets emotional for the other characters.

I love every character in this show, extra, side, main, doesn't matter. Each character has a personality and a backstory to them. Spike is a wise man with badass karate moves, life lessons and generally a backstory to cry over. Jet, man, who doesn't wanna be this guy? He's just cool and chill, he gets the job done, handles situations. Just a cool character. Faye Valentine is really a broken character who is trying to learn her past. And when you do learn it, you feel so sad for this character. Edward is wacky and love them. Enough said.

The animation is really well done even for a  1999 anime. For being some of the last anime to use hand drawn animation, it really is impressive. The music, ah. Man, the music. It's a mix of jazz and blues. Fuck me it's amazing. Each track is filled to the brim with amazing music. The opening is orgasmic and the ending is calming and just a beauty. 

Overall, this show is just bad-ass. That's the one word I can say about this show. It has good storytelling, likable characters, superb animation and orgasmic music. If I can say a couple of minor issues. The first 4 episodes are extremely slow paced and try to introduce you to the show, but trust me. It sure may be a little boring, but after those 4 episodes. Episodes 5 & 6 are simply not only some of the best episodes of the show, but the best episodes in all of anime and TV. That's the only complaint I have with this show. So please, do yourself a favor and go watch this masterpiece. Also, watch the English dub, this is one of the only times I prefer dub over sub.

    ***I originally posted this review on Anime-Planet***

Critic's Log: Earthdate - March 12, 2012. Review #1: Cowboy Bebop.

It is the year 2071 and Mars has become the central hub of human civilization ever since a hyperspace experiment on the moon failed and made Earth uninhabitable. The entire Solar System has been accessible thanks to reliable hyperspace gates and crime syndicates have exerted their power and influence over the government and the ISSP (Inter-Solar System-Police). As a result, The ISSP has put in a bounty system similar to The Old West has been included to deal with fugitives, terrorists and other criminals. The bounty hunters are usually

          
        called "Cowboys". Bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black are flying around space and trying to catch their bounty.

That is the premise of Cowboy Bebop. This is where I start to get technical, Cowboy Bebop does not have much of a main storyline (except for episodes like Ballad of Fallen Angels, the Two-part episode Jupiter Jazz and the two part finale The Real Folk Blues), and those 5 episodes are what you could call "plot" episodes, while the remaining 21 are standalone episodes. With that said, those episodes are not even considered filler. Some of the ideas in these standalone really stand out impressively. Here are some examples: Sympathy for the Devil, Waltz for Venus, Ganymede Elegy, etc., etc...

If there is a blinding aspect, it is the animation. For 1998, the animation was pretty good back then and still looks good today. Some episodes have some cool animation effects as well. Sunrise is the animation studio behind Cowboy Bebop and that might not be saying much, however there is one apparent note about this show, apparently Cowboy Bebop's success led to 3 staff members from Sunrise that co-founded the studio that we know today as Studio Bones. In other words, animes like RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Eureka Seven, Darker than BLACK, Soul Eater, and both Fullmetal Alchemist animes were apparently made possible due to Bebop's success. The action scenes are well animated, and the visuals are even breathtaking at times.

If there are any anime purists out there that have not seen Cowboy Bebop yet, consider this recommendation an exception, the English dub is very good and hardly flawed. Steven Jay Blum gives Spike a good badass tone to his character, Wendee Lee sounds both sexy and sensitive as Faye, Beau Billingslea has a cool father-like tone as Jet, and Melissa Fahn is charmingly silly as Edward. The dub can be considered better than the original Japanese version of the show, and I have known some purists that mention that Cowboy Bebop's dub was very good. I personally love the dub, it was spot-on and all the voices matched. So, what do I think of the subtitled version? Answer: I find it Underrated compared to the dub. The voice cast of the subtitled version had some well-known voice actors such as Kouichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara, Unsho Ishizuka, and even Norio Wakamoto is in the subbed version. There is nothing wrong with the subtitled version; it may be a bit overshadowed by the dubbed Version

f there is an aspect that struck all the chords right is the soundtrack which is by Yoko Kanno. Some people consider Bebop's soundtrack to be her best. There is one fact about the soundtrack is that Kanno-san formed a band known as The Seatbelts which includes over 70 musicians which resided in Japan, New York, and Paris. I consider it impressive. If you try listening to the soundtrack without the show, it may feel like you're listening to an album rather than a soundtrack. The soundtrack really made a permanent impression on me. My personal favorite moment that involved the soundtrack was the two songs used in the cathedral scene, which were Rain and Green Bird. Hell, the opening theme kicks so much ass, and The Real Folk Blues is a good closing theme. The soundtrack is groovy

What really makes the show impressive is that some scenes have music playing and not have much dialogue in it. This is somewhat of a symbolic example that silence can indeed be golden. This is Kanno-sans most famous and critically acclaimed soundtrack. Otakus mostly rejoice when Kanno san is involved in musical compositions ever since she finished her work on Cowboy Bebop. She is mostly a fan favorite in the anime fan base when it comes to the music department and that should come as no surprise. Shes that popular and talented. I do appreciate the work she has done up to this very day.

The characters are also great. Spike is shown as a rogue badass with a past catching up to him. Jet appears to be a cool guy who happens to be the Captain of the Bebop. Faye is a con-woman and an interesting character even though she is kind of rude. Ein is adorable, and Edward is a silly random character that has a positive outlook in life. I think she was an awesome character for comic relief in the show. Some minor characters were also interesting. There is a common theme that runs through all of the characters and that is the pasts of these characters. It's definitely an overused trope but I think the past is something we all quite can't forget which doesn't make this trope clichd, it's just a common one that is almost always effective.



Cowboy Bebop claims to be a genre unto itself. I am not sure how to give a clear analogy on that, but it has interesting themes that are unique to the show. There are some homages and send ups to famous movies in this show. This is a show that knew how to treat adults and people who like movies, music, Science Fiction, Western and so forth. Shinichiro Watanabe really nailed the direction of this anime because he always liked to mix up different opposing styles to make something completely new and unordinary. Cowboy Bebop has elements of Western, Space Opera, Film Noir, Martial Arts, and Jazz music. All these elements blended extremely well and this was a very unique anime at the time and I can understand why this anime was so revolutionary at the time. End Result: WINNING!


Since the popularity of Cowboy Bebop soared past through the stars, is it even fair to say that this show is overrated? It is considered an influential anime and I see why, a lot of people have universally praised the hell out of this show. The stories, animation, characters, music, and style are blended in so well that it almost makes it hard to see animes of this caliber.

If there is a drawback, I could say that this show could have gone a bit longer, and on a personal note, Boogie Woogie Feng Shui was the only episode I did not like too much. If you like it, that's fine.

If you stick to the series long enough, I guarantee you'll like the ending. There are a lot of people that see the ending as one of the most fitting endings to an anime and it really ends with a bang. I'm dead serious, if you haven't seen this series then do yourself a favor and watch the damn show, it will not disappoint you unless you are extremely picky.

Cowboy Bebop is available by Bandai Entertainment, and even though Bandai Entertainment no longer licenses anime, they mentioned that they will keep their current catalog, so apparently there's nothing to worry about this anime being out of print in the US (I hope). The manga adaptation Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Cain Kuga and another manga adaptation of Cowboy Bebop also written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Yutaka Nanten were available by Tokyopop and It is possible that those two manga adaptations are out of print. Cowboy Bebop the Movie is available by Sony Pictures and I will review it next.

With that said, Cowboy Bebop is a smash hit jam-session that has become a genre unto itself; it has thrills, action, humor, and most of all fun. It is a hard one not to like. However, Not only anime fans like this show, some people that don't watch anime much or even anime-haters admit this show is exceptional and they even liked the show. This show has an American influence and it appeals to viewers that like anime, sci-fi, action flicks, and westerns. At the time I am posting this, this anime is still airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block since 2001. The constant re-runs and the fan base have turned this anime to a cult classic (metaphorically speaking, it has a devoted fan base... nothing to do with religious cults or something like that; it's a play on words). It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely worth trying. It's an anime I sometimes quote as well as some others. Some will say that this is the greatest anime ever made, but that may be stretching it too much, but I will agree in calling it a revolutionary anime and a fun anime at that.  it is truly a gem.

I give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10 (It is a MASTERPIECE!)


Feel free to leave me a comment and stay gold, Bang!

    Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter with a dark, violent past. Nowadays, he roams between the seedier colonies of space along with his partner Jet Black and their spaceship Bebop as they try to catch a bounty or two, barely making a living at it. Some of their bounties, like the mysterious Faye Valentine and the intelligent 'data dog', Ein, end up as fellow partners. Is Spike trying to justify prior misdeeds by working for the right side of the law? What will happen when his past catches up to him? And what of the pasts of his fellow shipmates? Will any of them survive

          
        long enough to find out? 

Cowboy Bebop has been often referred to as the new anime noir, a title that does fit, but doesn't even begin to fully describe it. Equal parts film noir, spaghetti western, and 70's cop show; Cowboy Bebop is both retro and fresh at the same time. A very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.

Cowboy Bebop is well suited to TV. Each episode manages to stand alone, but at the same time link together an overall larger story. Even if you only see two or three episodes, not exactly in order, one wouldn't be lost, and would find enjoyment in them. In order to truly appreciate it, though, one must see it through.

Cowboy Bebop also presents a realistic view of the future. Spike and Jet travel in what to us would be a highly sophisticated craft, but to them is the modern day equivalent of a 1976 El Camino. The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.

This striving for realism also is reflected in the character designs. Spike is lanky and handsome in his own way, but by no means is he a slender pretty boy. Faye is sexy and curvy, but she's no large breasted bimbo. Jet is burly, not fat, and has traits that would make one think he is of Russian descent. Ein can easily be recognized as a Welsh corgi, and not just another undistinguishable mutt. The only one who looks remotely like a 'cartoony' character is Ed, and even then no one would ever mistake her as anything -but- a scrawny preteen tomboy. (And to see her name and appearance, you'd think she just got off the boat from the Philippines.)

The animation is beyond superb. Its quality excels over most current releases. Cowboy Bebop uses computer graphics, but does so in such a fluid, breathtaking manner. There are practically no scenes that feel 'artificial', like what's going on in the foreground is totally separate from the background. Many computer-generated anime can't seem to shake the look that the characters are just floating in front of the background stills. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.

Another bonus Cowboy Bebop has going for it is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno scores (literally) again with her work for this series. The opening theme alone is already one of *the* best intro pieces I have ever heard. The blend of jazz and blues is absolutely perfect in setting the mood of the series. I ask you, has this woman ever -done- any bad music? (Of course not!)

Then there's the storyline. Even though each episode stands quite well on its own, with poignant moments interspersed with exciting action, the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what he does is absolutely intriguing. With each flashback, you get one more piece of the puzzle, from Spike's shady origins to the loves that influenced the way he is. Maybe his bounty hunting is really a search for identity as much as a way of life he has chosen. The plot and characterization in Cowboy Bebop have a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind. It's hard to find movies this involving, much less animated television series. Cowboy Bebop simply puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame.

On the surface, it's easy to dismiss as '70s retro fluff. "Hey, there's Vega$ all over again!" And yes, many a Japanese and American movie star or feature is lampooned in one form or another during each episode. Cases in point: Spike Spiegel is a postmodern Lupin III. And in the first episode alone, Asimov Sorenson and Katarina.... can we say Desperado, kids? (Heck, even Quentin Tarantino seems to have a cameo!) But beneath that noir veneer is a very human drama that has just enough humor and clever dialogue to be realistic, yet highly entertaining. This is a must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.
Simply put, this anime is one of the best.

    Cowboy Bebop is one of the few series that got recommended to me by both my real life friend and my net friends. I really wanted to like this show, I was so excited to watch this and my expectations were at an all time high which is what led me to dub cowboy bebop as the most disappointing anime ever

There are definitely worse, much worse series out there of course but I never expected much from them. Cowboy bebop however, is one of the most loved anime and everything I heard about it was positive which ultimately led me to expect Cowboy Bebop to

          
        be an masterpiece that cannot be hated by anyone. Boy was I wrong

Well, that's enough of that, let's get on with my review

Story:
Cowboy Bebop is episodic for the most part and what's worse is that it's pretty much in the monster of the week format. There are a lot of standalone episodes in the series that aren't really important but they tried to force it at the end. I didn't like most of the standalone episodes but I hated what they did at the end even more

Characters:
They were able to give the most of the main cast a believable back story which properly explained why they acted the way they did. Not much of Ed's past is revealed though like why she even knew how to hack and what motivates her to act the way she does. They could've inserted that anywhere given how much standalone episodes they have but they didn't

Art and Animation:
I don't really mind the art style but some of the scenes just took me out of the anime because of how terribly animated they were but this can be forgiven because this is a 90s anime. The animation for the wormholes in particular were absolutely nauseous 

Sound:
I'm not a fan of Jazz so I have nothing to say about the music


Enjoyment:
This is one of the few anime where I actually had to push myself just to finish. I usually just drop them but given how highly acclaimed the series I held on unto hope that maybe, just maybe the next episode would be better and it wouldn't bore me out of my mind but no, that didn't happen and when I finished this series, I was just glad that it was finally over and I can finally watch something that I actually like. This series was boring from start to finish, the only exception being episode 8, the sole episode that I like

Overall:
It's not as good as people make it out to be and it failed to live up to my expectations but most importantly, and when I say most importantly, I mean that this is the only part that matters for me, it was boring and I didn't enjoy it which is why I'm going to give this a 6. 

Oh hey I just checked but my overall score for Cowboy Bebop is still a 6 if i take the average of my scores for it's separate aspects. 6.25 if I didn't count my score for the music (I divided it by 4 ofc, I'm not that dumb)

I don't think numbers can properly convey how much you like or dislike a show so take this sentence as my rating:
It still had some bits that I enjoyed but it was really boring as a whole. 

P.S. This is ofc just my opinion so don't send me death threats for this, okay? Cool?

    Cowboy Bebop. The show that makes you feel so bad ass you rob a bank, kill a hooker, and inject steroids right into your cock! The show that will have you sayin see you space cowboy after every episode and right when the credits roll you start up the next episode like the fat piece of glorious shit you are. I know im a lil late to the party but I wanted to review this gem since it's one of my favorites and all. So lets get into the review ladies, gentlemen, transgenders, and all people who identify as a trans queer Doppelganger Mc Flurry

          
        Feminist Neo Nazi because im not trying to offend anyone, please don't hurt me. By the way, this contains spoilers if you're the 1 out of 10 people who has not seen Cowboy Bebop yet.



Story:

In all honesty I didn't get into Cowboy Bebop for it's story line, sure it was there but that's not what drew me in, it was the action baby! This isn't to say the story is bad I loved how it was episodic. In fact for it's time this was something unique and different. I liked how every episode was a different adventure and it felt fresh with new and amazing characters and new people joining the main crew and sort of becoming a family of sorts if you wanna call it that. The only gripe I had was that the ending felt sort of unsatisfying for me and this really is just my opinion but I felt like it was sort of rushed and what I mean is that end fight with Vicious felt lame af, how you gonna let that nigga kill you and you got a pistol when he had a close range weapon? You managed to get a shot on that fool! He wasn't invincible and you could of brought a machine gun up in there and blasted his ass sky high! Naw im playin it was a good ending, the bang at the end was cool and all that shit. 9/10



Art:

The animation was fantastic, you aren't gonna get anything this good these days. Now most shit consists of low budget CGI (Im looking at you berserk 2016!), I feel like all anime looks alike nowadays (THATS RACIST) but it's like everything is drawn so cutesy, one reason I can't watch DBZ Super even tho i really want to just the dub needs to hurry the fuck up, Japs voices always trigger my great grandpas PTSD so i can't watch it. But anyways the art is great, love Fayes Tits. 9/10



Sound:

The voice acting and musical score in this show is godly. It's like experiencing sex with Sophia Vergara while Beyonce makes out with you and Lisa Ann fondles your ball sack and fingers your butt hole all at once! Never have I heard English voice acting this good not even today. It all sounds like shit with a few exceptions here and there like a minor bit of Funimations work but it still doesn't compare. And that lovely Jazz music is the cherry on top of this beautiful sundae. 10/10


Characters:

Spike has to be one of my favorite MC's of all time. He's in my top 10 list and for good reason. Who doesn't love a space bounty hunter with a dark past and a humorous attitude? Jet's also a cool dude who can cook a mean bell peppers and beef (hold the beef). Faye is the bad ass chick every show needs one of those for boobs and what not, she has a cool backstory. And then there's Ed.... wtf is that a boy or a girl? That bitch would have professor Oak give up raising Pokemon just to figure out the gender of this nigga. Oh yeah and there's Ein the dog, he barks and shit. 10/10


Enjoyment:

So, did I enjoy Cowboy Bebop? Does Kim Kardashian finger Kanyes butt hole? Is Xvideos better than porn hub? Did my father leave me at a young age because I was a failure as a son? I didn't just enjoy Cowboy Bebop, this was the first show i legit jerked off to, it took me on a ride ill never forget and it made me so erect my cock broke through space and time itself. I've never been on a trip like this ever since I took acid back in high school. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will most definitely maintain an erection for more than 5 hours. 10/10



Overall Score: 10/10

 would be an 11 if this rating system wasn't shit.

    Story
Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized, but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.

Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with

          
        the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.


Animation
Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them.

For it's time, Cowboy Bebop was about as good as television animation got. The style was classically anime, big eyes no nose, small mouth. The fighting animation is very fluid and detailed. But what most impressed me about Cowboy Bebop's animation was the variety of locals, and the lived in natures of every environment that is visited. From the Bebop itself, with its endless rooms and corridors to variety of ethnic architecture, it is truly a treat to behold. The computer graphics are dated by today's standard, but for its time was cutting edge.


Sound
Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.


Characters
Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.


Overall
The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.

    The most overhyped and overrated anime of all time in my opinion. The first 20 or so episodes are pretty much random bounty hunting episodes then near the end of the series they try to throw in some ridiculous plot involving a &quot;Syndicate&quot;. The animation and art was subpar, the sound and music were very nice though. Overall Cowboy Bebop is disappointing and very much a forgettable series. If you want to see a good series from Cowboy Bebop's director Shinichiro Watanabe check out Samurai Champloo

    How can I possibly review "Cowboy Bebop"? The show has been reviewed, and re-reviewed, and talked about, and taken apart, been overrated, underrated, and just done to death that at this point my words would make about as much difference as if I were to drop a lit match onto the surface of the sun. But, maybe my words will read and maybe you the reader will be aided by them. 

The word I can use to describe this Anime best is cool. From the characters, to the artwork, to the soundtrack, to the dialogue. It's a smooth, fun, futuristic ride through this 26-episode series.

          
        Most episodes are stand alone with a few two part ones that deal with the big picture plot of the series. It has a massive tech-noir flavor, futuristic settings that are fogged by clouds of cigarette smoke and a jazz melody in the background. I hope the future is this cool. 

The characters in this show are unforgettable and grow on you very quickly. Spike Spiegel, the mellow martial arts bounty hunter with a mysterious past. Jet Black, the grizzled ex-cop with a cybernetic arm who enjoys gardening. Faye Valentine, the grifting femme fatale who always ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ed, the little girl with a boys name who is a total genius and total goof, and Ein the Dog. He does dog stuff.  

Now, don't go into this show expecting to be blown away. The amount of praise this show gets makes it sound like it will change your life, lower your taxes, and improve your gas mileage. It's a great show. A masterpiece. But step back, take a deep breath, and watch one episode at a time when you can. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't binge. I find this is best way to enjoy the show. Sub vs. Dub is a surprising big win for the dub. Steve Blum, Wendee Lee, Beau Billingslea, and Melissa Fahn as Spike, Faye, Jet, and Ed play their parts to perfection and set the gold standard for every English dub before or since. If all English casts were as good as this, subtitles would not be necessary.

I hope this review has helped you out and I thank you for taking the time to read it. Please enjoy "Cowboy Bebop" as much as I did. It's a great show. And a must-see for any Anime fan. 10/10. Check it out. Cheers!

    I'm going to be quite honest here, most episodic anime, such as Cowboy Bebop really doesn't do a whole lot for me. But it's strange, in all it's 26 episode glory, Cowboy Bebop has managed to do what no other anime has ever done and that is too ensnare me in it's word right from the beginning never failing in letting me go. Cowboy Bebop is, quite simply, my favorite Anime ever. No other anime has shown me such a perfectly balanced world, with such an awe-inspiring atmosphere dripping with originality like Cowboy Bebop has. 

For starters, it's entirely character driven. The show lives and

          
        dies by how it manages to get you to connect with its characters. Cowboy Bebop is one of those rare shows that you don't really need to have a favorite character (although we all do, mine is Spike like most people) because you love all the characters so much you being to sympathize and feel connected with every one of them. It's story is also mixed with a perfect marriage between drama and humor. I've seen people call Cowboy Bebop one of the most depressing anime they've ever seen and I've seen other people call Cowboy Bebop the funniest anime they've seen. The reason it can be so funny without intruding on the seriousness of the plot, is due to the fact that unlike most humor in anime, the humor in Cowboy Bebop is deftly subtle. There are really no instances where the show seems immature or chained to conventional anime humor cliches' and I really can't help but appreciate it all the more. You'll laugh, you'll smile, I wanna say you'll cry, but I didn't, your heart strings will definitely be tugged at a time or seven. The thing the series is most notable for, however, is definitely the music. It's more or less a blend of jazz, blues and contemporary rock that almost blends too naturally with the Space Cowboy setting. Each episode has a different musical theme and the Bebop series really gave me the majority of my favorite anime music. 

Listen, I can sit here and talk about how great Cowboy Bebop is all day, but the more I do that, the less time you'll have to sit down and watch it yourself. This is simply one of those anime series that you NEED to watch to call yourself a proper anime fan. I'm not saying you'll love it as much as I do, but if you don't at least give Cowboy Bebop a chance, you're a fool.

    "Men only think about their past right before death, as if they were searching frantically for proof they were alive." ~Jet Black

FOREWORD:
For those of you who have grown up watching good anime your whole life, let me tell you a little secret: there was a time not all that long ago when translated, licensed episodes didn't exist in the U.S. This wasn't just because most people didn't know about it; in reality, the majority of Americans simply weren't interested. Cowboy Bebop changed all that. 

SUMMARY:
Of all the shows I've ever seen, this one takes the cake. Just because it's old doesn't mean you shouldn't watch

          
        it- in fact, it's pretty difficult nowadays to find anything of a similar caliber amidst the never ending wave of eye-candy garbage that big name companies have begun to produce. 

Cowboy Bebop will lead you on an incredible adventure- one that is certainly full of tasteful humor and suspense, but also possesses an unexpected level of depth and meaning. It will draw you in gently with its art and sound, captivate you with its character development, and move your soul with its plot. 

The lighting, angles, and details in the art are unmatched. The music, too, is tasteful and unique, and compliments the atmosphere of each scene exquisitely. Every character is developed meaningfully throughout the show, and their distinct personalities are coordinated in a way that is both refreshing and endearing. 

This show will take your breath away. It will open up new vistas of thought, and leave you with a heart that better understands- if only a little- what it truly means to be human.

    I watched it because everyone said it is a masterpiece and must to watch but it ended up being disappointing. 
The overall anime is good and it had promise to be even better. In my point of view it had way too many pointless filler episodes and didn't really find good balance between being serious and laughable. I felt like the seriousness of the whole story was bit diminished by the fact that there were so many episodes just for laugh and giggles. 
I think that this anime would have been way better with a little bit more serious tone. It let me a bit

          
        confused. Not bad anime by any means. Its just,,,I expected it to be bit better.

    Cowboy Bebop is different from other anime in that it does not focus on a linear storyline to progress through the series. It is like a series of short stories that all use the same characters in different scenarios to see how they react when presented with a challenge. However, not all the sessions are disconnected. As we get further into the series, we delve into the past of each character, which gives us a better understanding of how and why each of them act the way they do. This show is more character driven than anything, and because of the memorable characters it provides,

          
        Cowboy Bebop is a masterpiece. 

Story/ Pacing - 9/10
I rate the story a 9 although, as I said before, there is not really a linear storyline. Bebop is not your typical anime in that it is episodic. Each "session" presents the characters with a different problem, whether it be chasing another bounty or solving a personal issue. These are usually resolved within the same session, save for the pair of two-parters and the many questions about the characters and their backstory. In fact, most of the sessions do not seem to be connected because of the difference in plot. However you soon find this to be untrue as more and more is uncovered about the history of each character. The story does not deserve a perfect score because the show's focus is not on the story, but instead atmosphere and the characters.

Art - 9/10 
Cowboy Bebop is often seen as a classic anime not only because of the reception it received, but its age. Going on 16 years since its release, it has that retro art feel that can be compared to a Miyazaki film. Every scene is filled with incredible detail, and the characters are no exception. Everything in this anime looks beautiful. There is no laziness in the animation itself, which makes everything flow and look natural. 

Sound/Music - 9/10 
This is a difficult portion to judge. The voices many times are quite grainy and echoey, but it is important to remember that this is an older anime and the sound standards have been improved since its debut. In my opinion it doesn't take away from the show or experience whatsoever, but that is up to the viewer to decide. The music is really what makes the sound category worthy of praise. The introduction song, Tank!, gets you excited for the upcoming events with its fast pace beat and memorable "3, 2, 1, Let's jam" to get things rolling. The music is placed perfectly alongside events so to help convey the emotions of the characters.

Characters - 10/10
The characters are really what make this anime special. All of them bring a unique personality to the table, making the crew well rounded. These differing personalities do clash, but nonetheless, it is obvious how close the crew gets. All of them have mysterious pasts that are uncovered as you progress through the series. Every question that comes up should be answered by the end (depending on how you view the series conclusion). As I've stated before, the show's primary focus is on the history of each character and their individual desires regarding resolving personal crises. They are truly a memorable cast and are the main reason this show is a classic. 

Enjoyment - 10/10
This section is much less objective than the others because someone can tell you all the contributing factors that make a show good or bad but it is up to the viewer to decide whether or not they actually enjoy it. I found it incredibly easy to enjoy because the pacing is never slow and something interesting is always happening. This is thanks to the episodic nature of the series, which allows almost every session to tell another story. 

Overall - 9/10 
This show is a masterpiece. It's aesthetic value alone makes it a work of art. The Wild West influences and incredible amount of musical references make it appealing to a wide demographic. The use of sessions rather than linked episodes catalyzes a pace and storyline that both make the series very entertaining. The characters are all unique and very easy to get attached to. All these elements came together to create the perfect storm that is Cowboy Bebop. If you have not seen it already, I highly recommend that you take the time to do so.

    Cowboy Bebop is a popular high rated anime though many people finds it bad and it is  dropped a lot. Am I surprised of either one of both? Actually not. I am one of the few who is in between of them. So I can understand the arguments of both sides. This is a difficult serie for me to rate. Since the things they have done good are extremely good however for the bad things counts the same. Trying to guide you aswell as me trough my thoughts. Isnt the most obvious thing to do. But I will give it a try.

So lets begin

          
        with the story: It is basically about bounty hunters from the year 2072. These bounty hunters are referred as cowboys a lot in the serie and bebop is the name of their spaceship, if I am not mistaken. So that is where the title comes from. I dont think there is anything else important to know for now.


The first thing I would like to tell you about the serie is that it is very episodic (If that is even a word). I meant that every episode tells its own story and all those stories gives an idea of their life. I personally dont like that fact because then you cannot be sucked in the serie as it is supposed to be. That is another reason why I had difficulties to get into the serie and I think that is probably one of the reasons why so many people dropped this anime. On top of that some episodes felt bad and a lot felt like they are fillers. However the good episodes where very good and very amusing to watch. Thats why it is very difficult to criticize the story. Simply because it exist out of 24 different stories. I just dont like to put a number on the whole bunch and if I would do it on the whole serie it wont be good either, since it doesnt has a real plot or something because of this. But I can tell that my rating of these stories goes from 3 to 9 with the higher numbers in the end. Probably cause I started to appreciate the style more. Though the end isnt built up as good as the other anime series, it is really good and suits the anime perfectly.

I am not really a sci-fi fan, especially things like star wars. This was completely different though. They didnt put any attention to the future gadgets. I think they did it just for some more spectacular action scenes with those ships. It gave me actually more the feeling that it happened in the past then in the future. especially with those old (beautiful) drawings and the jazz, blues, classic background music. This is all positive in my opinion though. I really like the serie way better as it is.

Guess it is time to go more positive now the worse part of it is done. The best part of the serie for me was without doubt the music. The way they make blues, jazz and classic music exiting is unbelievable! Or is it that what makes the serie exciting? To be honest I dont know, the only thing I know is that it perfectly suits each other. The way they made the combination let even me enjoy classic music. They really overmastered James Bond with it. Cowboy Bebop just puted Jazz music in the action scenes While James Bond need those good action scenes to get popular. The way they add those weird random sounds at it is really risky. But it is done so great that I love it. The fact that it is so original makes it good. I can understand that a lot of people (especially the younger ones) cannot appreciate that music and surely not in this way. But for me it just made the serie.

The characters are pretty good to. Especially Jet and Spike (the main characters) in my opinion. the other ones arent bad but they didnt got me that much. Probably because The episodes where a new character joins are boring in my opinion. But I must admit that they are all very original. The episodes that goes about Jet and Spike and the way they develop them (slowly but good and full of charm) are very good. That is one of the reasons I absolutely fell in love with those characters. 

However the drawings are old and not that good at first sight, I really started to like them. Spike his look, his hair, his poses, his fights, his cigarettes,  It is all just drawn so beautiful. It may look old but it is still full of charm and emotion. Not only Spike is well drawn but he is just the climax of the drawings in this serie.

So that is why I have double feelings for this wonderful seinen serie.

See You Space Cowboy...

    *In this review I will be switching to a different reviewing system/format.

Cowboy Bebop is often considered one of the greatest anime of all time. Ive considered watching it for a long time, but I never really got around to it until recently. And now that Ive finally watched it, I regret not watching the show sooner, not only because it was a good series, but also because I think that if it had been one of the first anime that I watched I wouldve liked it a lot more.

Story:

The story takes place all over the universe in the year 2071. Cowboy Bebops story revolves around

          
        four main characters, Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and Edward. They are all bounty hunters aboard Jets ship the Bebop. My main issue with the series as a whole is how the story is told. Its told in a way that makes every episode seem like a small stand-alone story. The series was too episodic, and there were very few episodes that actually felt connected to each other. That being said, my favorite episodes were the ones that focused on the backgrounds of the characters, even though an overall plot really didnt connect all of them. I just wished that Cowboy Bebop had a more focused narrative.

Animation:

Id heard nothing but good things about the animation in Cowboy Bebop; but, since it came out in 1998, I wasnt sure how much I would like it. Im glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the animation. There were times where I thought, Wow, this was made in 1998? But there were other times where I thought, Yeah, this was made in 1998. Overall, the animation is solid throughout the entire series.

Sound:

The sound in Cowboy Bebop is one of the best parts of this series. The whole sound track has a soulful and jazzy vibe. The only issue I have with the sound is that the only songs that you hear multiple times are the songs of the opening and ending. This isnt really a bad thing. The opening and ending are both really good, but there are just so many good songs you hear throughout the series that I wish that they wouldve used more often. Most of the songs are episode specific, so the music definitely fits the overall themes and tones of the episode, but youll probably never hear those songs again throughout the entire series.

Characters:

The characters are the most interesting part of this series. They all and have totally different personalities, and reasons for becoming bounty hunters. All of them have a mysterious past, which they are either not willing to talk about or just dont remember. As I said earlier, my favorite episodes in the series are the ones that focus on the backgrounds of the characters. This is partially because these episodes feel the most connected in terms of an overarching narrative, and also partially because I found those episodes the most entertaining. Spikes background episodes in particular had the some of, if not, the best action scenes in the entire series. There are also several supporting and side characters in the series, but you usually wont see them in more than one episode. This is fine because during that one episode that they are in their entire story or reason for being there is explained pretty well.

Enjoyment:

Like I said earlier, I think that if this had been one of the first anime that Id ever watched I wouldve liked this series a lot more than I do. Dont get me wrong, Cowboy Bebop is an entertaining series, but it has a very episodic format that took away some of the enjoyment for me.

Verdict & Breakdown:

Story: 3.4/5

Animation: 3.5/5

Sound: 4/5

Characters: 4/5

Enjoyment: 3.5/5

Verdict: 3.7/5

Even though I dont think this series is a masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop is a classic anime that is definitely worth checking out.

Favorite Episodes: Ballad of Fallen Angels, Hard Luck Woman, and The Real Folk Blues Parts 1-2.

    How do you know if youre cool? If you have to ask then youre not cool. Cowboy Bebop is cool. Not just  because we all say it is, but it just is. Thats its natural state of being; cool. 
Cowboy Bebop came out at a time when the anime industry was trying to find that next Pokemon, flooding the market with kiddie stuff that alienated those of us from the OVA era. Wheres the adult oriented stuff that made us fall in love with this subgenre? We thought anime was dead. Then comes Cowboy Bebop and faith is restored. 
Cowboy Bebop is the story

          
        of everyday life for adults. You work, try and put food on the table, and hope you dont die in the effort. Some may dislike it for that very reason. Lots of anime focus on the optimism of youth and the potential that it brings. Cowboy Bebop shows the grey drudgery of the daily grind that awaits us after school. It plays with the facets of lifes perspective; 
Faye a woman running to a past she cannot remember, Spike is running from his past to live in the present, Jet abandoned his past though is always comes back to haunt him and Ed lives solely for the moment never once thinking about the future. 
They smoke, they drink, they gamble, theyre all looking for a quick fix to end their financial woes. Sadly, thats what being an adult is all about. Cowboy Bebop illustrates this with a beauty, style and grace that makes us want to endure it. Never has our bleak future seemed so fun and worthwhile.
Also Yoko Kanno did the score. I was familiar with her work on Macross Plus, my all time favorite anime (this is the best Mac+ is my fav) and source of my all time favorite song. Her touch adds to the sensory experience making you feel the the series as opposed to simply watching it. When I found out she did the soundtrack to Kids On The Slope, I immediately set myself to watch it.
I want to add something personal to this review. Cowboy Bebop came to me at a time in my life when I needed it the most. So I understand people who swear Naruto & Shippuden is the greatest thing ever, if it was that series for them. Despite the fact I want to shake them like a British nanny (cuz its not), I understand them. For me Cowboy Bebop is one of those anime, like comfort food. No  matter bad a day Im having, I know Im just one episode of Cowboy Bebop away from making it that much better.
It is in fact the greatest anime ever made.

    Cowboy Bebop was supposed to be a gateway drug - it was supposed to get people (i.e. young Americans) hooked onto sophisticated and beautiful anime. And it did just that.  

However, what happens when someone gets hooked onto the more classic Japanese anime first and then regresses to watch Cowboy Bebop? Well, for starters, the appreciation for the show is completely redefined. 

First, lets start with the basics of this show. Its a futuristic show about adventurous bounty hunters with scarred pasts who travel in their spaceship Bebop throughout the solar system capturing criminals. That in and of itself is prime for creating an

          
        incredible story. So, our characters Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and their dog (forgot his name already) create some sort of melded family that is both entertaining and quite heartening to watch. Their dynamic is the story, and their dynamic is what makes the plot so neat to watch. 

The key feature of the plot is the build of the show. Cowboy Bebop has an intricate 26-episode long spread that are separate but connected episodes. For example, most of the episodes are all individual stories in and of themselves, however they give an overarching theme hooks you on. And the story that has been building throughout the entire show begins to really solidify towards the end. Each character seemingly has their own ongoing stories that converge and develop, most notably our great protagonists Spike - but more on that later. 

Second, the build. Since the build of the show is not continuous (one clear running storyline comprised of many episodes), this structure enables this theme of dis-attachment that is so quintessential the show. What do I mean by that? For example, if we take Naruto, many fans get attached to the characters because they closely track their actions over a long period of time and get to see them overcome difficulties that have been going on for years. However, its different with Cowboy Bebop. Given their roles as rogue bounty hunters and space travelers, our characters already tend to not attach themselves to too many things and roam to the melody of their own unbound spirit. This perhaps is the greatest message that the construction of this show portrays in my humble opinion. Its a sweet reminder to not get stuck in the past and follow whatever wherever your heart points you - to do that which you need to do.  

Other quick notes on the build - the animation is solid. I didnt feel like I was watching a show from the 90s because they apparently remastered it in 1080, so honestly it was better than most of the newer anime that I have seen. Refreshing to say the least. 

Next, the characters. This 1998 anime is cult of personality and character. Maybe its due to the age of the show and the genuine creative spirit of its producers. I dont care what, but they nailed it for sure. The characters are all amazing in their own respect.  The character who I obviously have to start with (and the only one Ill write about) is Spike Spiegel. Since I dont think my writing can do justice to how well-developed his character is, I am going to keep it short. Spike is for certain people - hes the solution to both the human conditions of boredom and wanderlust. For those stuck in the same place all the time, Spike embodies the freedom-loving characteristic that inspires adventure and personality. For those lost in the infinity of wanderlust, he exudes a sense of conviction (despite his apparent lack of professional dedication). He, as so many have aptly put, is cool in his uncool. Despite the fact that this is a short 26 episode show, he is undoubtedly one of my favorite characters in anime. But thats the thing: Spike is the kind of character that a creator simply can not maintain in a long anime - he is too much of an ideal as opposed to building a practical and (relatively) simple character like Naruto or Kenshin. 

Interestingly, it isnt quite old-school, but it isnt quite futuristic either. Since the show is so focused on characters, it seems that the personality of these characters makes it an easy show to admire throughout the years (no matter how old the show gets). Its timeless.  Cowboy Bebop is the cult of personality and individuality 

The things that I have mentioned so far constitute the core of the cake. But what about the frosting? Music. The final thing that I want to delve into is music. The jazz and hip accompaniments are so quintessential so the show because they maintain a symbiotic relationship with the personality of the core four characters. The music helps complement their personalities, and the characters personalities are captured by the viewers through the help of the music. Many artists have written tributes to Cowboy Bebop through their music (ie. Saib - one of my favorite hip artists). If you watch the show, I highly recommend listening to the Cowboy Bebop jazz composition playlist on Spotify - if you watch and like this show, you will appreciate this playlist (regardless of your music taste). 

Anyway enough talk. 

We all know that any 1+1+1 does not equal 3. There is a synergy that arises from all the components of this show that put it in an emotional realm that is immune to the rules of math and logic. That is Cowboy Bebop. A solid 10 - nothing less.

    Ahoi Space Cowboys,

i want to put my thoughts and feelings into words, after finishing Cowboy Bebop.

I started watching the show, due to the overwhelming ratings and positive reviews. Unfortunally i put it on hold after watching the first two episodes. My first thought was: "overrated". Just a story about some unlucky bounty hunters who were after some Woolongs.

A couple of months later, i gave the Bebop another chance and oh boy i'm so glad that i did. As the show progresses, you begin to understand the crew and you want them to succed in every misery they are put in. The character development is great

          
        and it propels the dynamic of the crew to new hights. Moreover, if you want to fall in love with a ficitional character, than look no further than Faye. She's just amazing.

The moment that made me fall in love with the show was at the end of "A Ballad of Fallen Angels". The excellent music, the cinematography, the introduction of a vicious villan and the jaw dropping action was enough to get me fully on board.

Does the show has it flaws? Of course! However, the exceptional detail of every aspect in this world, the masterful introduction of new characters, the energetic soundtrack, the philosohpical moments, the great quotes and the believable acts from the main cast makes the show feel so damn real.

Finally i asked myself, what defines a masterpiece? My answer was: a show that leaves a deep impact within you, a show that propels your imagination, a show that made you cry, laugh and scream, a show that leaves you empty after i ends, and a show that will set a new scale for others to come. That's the reason why i will carry that weight and give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10.

    Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series. By episodic, I mean that one episode doesn't necessarily lead or follow the next one. With that being said, don't expect a lot of "plot" in this series. You watch Cowboy Bebop for the characters, plain and simple. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, Ein are what make this anime arguably one of the most memorable series ever produced. The music is awesome (especially if you're a fan of Jazz), the animation is top notch (considering when the series came out), and the enjoyment value is second to none.

While a lot of people want that "similar episode" feel, if you're the

          
        kind of person that enjoys a fast paced anime (with each character getting his or her own spotlight), this is for you. If you're not the type to enjoy fast paced, bounty huntin' fun, and rather you like deep thought provoking, dark, mysterious shows...don't watch Cowboy Bebop. Vicious (one of the characters) may be able to bring a little of that sinister side for you, but this isn't that kind of show.

    Cowboy Bebop is a whole collection of classic genres, all mixed into one series and all done right, to the point that it breathes new life into a very stale genre. If ever there was a series more deserving to be a sleeper hit, Bebop is it.

Many times have I visited Cowboy Bebop, and every time we've parted company I leave with a sense of how great a conversationalist Cowboy Bebop truly is. How it tells beautiful stories with nothing but ink, paint, computers, and sound. How it seems to transcend it's own media and become something unto itself. Nothing to be worshiped or canonized,

          
        but to be viewed with a measure of respect, and perhaps awe, that such a thing ever took place at all.

Cowboy Bebop, that's the story. There are cowboys and there is bebop, set against the backdrop of the future and space. The series concerns itself with the lives of Jet Black, Spike Spiegal, Faye Valentine, and Ed. The series itself tends to revolve around sorting out each characters past and reconciling it with their present selves. What sets Cowboy Bebop apart from similar series such as Outlaw Star is that these stories are actually interesting.

The places they visit are far from what one would expect. Instead of Neo-Tokyo with its shiny, impossibly tall skyscrapers that never end, we have Neo-Tijuana, with its dusty dirt roads, run down shacks and migrant workers. Space is ethnic, but not in the Star Trek sanitized for the sake of politically correctness way. Each colony reflects a melting pot more akin to Los Angeles or New York City than any Blade Runner wannabe ever could.

Characters from Cowboy Bebop each have stories to tell. Each deals with its past and present as best they can, although often times not very well at all. The plot is linear as far as the time line is concerned, but there isn't a penultimate goal sought after. In terms of the classic definitions of conflict, Cowboy Bebop tends towards the man versus himself, or man versus man types of conflict. The principles of Cowboy Bebop do not seek paradigm shifts, do not seek to change the world for the better or worse, but simply to live to see another day. This struggle to live on is what makes Cowboy Bebop so enjoyable, and what gives a humanity to the principle characters that they would otherwise lack.

Animation directors strive for different goals. Some, like Hayou Miyazaki seek a balance between we humans and nature. The director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii forewarned us that advancement without restraint presented dillemas with no solutions. Shincihiro Wantanbe gave us, with Cowboy Bebop, twenty-six pictures of a world coming to terms with its past. The methods vary, with death, resignation, and an eyes wide shut attitude dominating. 

But never are these heady themes forced upon us with a heavy hand. They are at many times hidden behind sharp humor, attention to detail, and jaw dropping animation. Only two times are these themes truly brought to a head: at the twelfth and thirteenth episodes (parts one and two of Jupiter Jazz), and episodes twenty-five and twenty-six (parts one and two of The Real Folk Blues). And at these moments the music gets better, the animation sharper, and like true climactic moments, they stay with us long after we finish watching them. Everything in Cowboy Bebop seems to breathe with life and motion, even in otherwise stoic scenes, and it's a rarity and a marvel to behold.

Never before or since has such a catalog of music been assembled for an anime, any anime. The principle creator of Cowboy Bebop's music, Yoko Kanno, took the high-road. She hopped from genre to genre in leaps and bounds while never taking from the animation itself, but infusing it with a pulse that at all times seemed perfect. Sometimes characters are defined through music, like Gren, whose sax playing pronounces him melancholy, disillusioned, and cavalier. Three original soundtracks were put together for this anime, each one is distinct and non-repetitious. Listening to them on their own gives you new appreciation on the quality of Yoko Kannos gift.

The concept of Cowboy Bebop is not original, but its execution is outstanding. The characters are not original, but how they interact with the world around them is. The music can be defined by genre, but the impact on the individual cannot. The animation has been topped over the years, the cgi definitely shows its age, but there are still moments of raw beauty that are still unparalleled. Cowboy Bebop is not a rite of passage in anime fandom, but it should be a signpost, showing you the difference between the sublime and the ordinary.

    The almighty and legendary Cowboy Bebop. Well, here goes my best shot. 

Story: 7,5
At first to me it seemed like Cowboy Bebop will be an episodic anime, which ones are usually plain bad and become boring after a few episodes. But Cowboy Bebop is a proof that anime mustn't evolve a single plot straight only to conclusion. Truth be said most of the Cowboy Bebop episodes are fillers, but not to the bad meaning of the fillers that you usually see in Naruto or Bleach or any other anime.

In Cowboy Bebop these episodes are more like expansions off the characters and mini stories with

          
        their own thoughts and meaning. Almost all of the episodes have some points to make and are relevant to the characters. They allow you to get more attached to characters. Sometimes you get small flashbacks in some episodes and they improve your understanding of how human and realistic these characters are.

As for the plot relevant episodes I would really have wanted more of them, because they seemed to answer a lot of questions, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. I really would want to know more about Spikes past. And the ending even though very cool and memorable for me seemed a bit dissapointing. Also if you think about it the main story is kinda cliche if not for the ending.

Visuals: 9,25
The visuals are more then you should ask for. Cowboy Bebop was made in 1998 and truth be it has put to shame other anime since 1998 to even now as for the visuals. The best I liked about it was how detailed it was, all the characters are easy to distinguish and backgrounds are very beautiful too. Backgrounds change a lot of times as the Bebop crew goes from different planets starting to mostly deserted planets to snowy cold planets. 

As for the animation it is very smooth and fluid, the action is very well choreographed and only once I saw repeated movement and I think it was done on purpose to make Ed look silly, not because the animators were lazy.

Sound: 10
Everything about sound is just WOW and awesome to the extreme. The opening is great and I didn't skip it once for all 26 episodes.

As for the background music there is a lot of it and even though it mostly consists of jazz, bebop and bluze it also had one episode with heavy metal and some other music too. The background music usually surprised me of how good it was all out through the series. That background music just made every major moment in this anime just so much more memorable and enjoyable.That's what you get from Yoko Kanno.

I personally only have seen the dub, but from what I heard it is one of the best, if not the best dubs out there . I think that Steve Blumes role as Spike Spiegel is his best.

Characters: 8 
It's not like you really get a lot of time spent on building up the characters, but somehow on the way you pick up pieces about Spike, Faye, Jet and Ed. As the series progresses you get some parts of there back-stories, but you don't get all of it. Well at least I thought that there could of been more back-stories for them. But I have to admit that it helped for extra realism that you don't know all about these characters from the start even to the end there are a lot mystery around them.

As for other characters they show up and disappear very soon except Vicous the villain ( his name sounds like a villain already)  who I didn't like, because a real villain needs to have a fucking good reason to be a villain, but all I got from him is that he has bad past with Spike, which really doesn't explain a lot, because we don't know much about Spikes past except for few flashbacks.

Enjoyment: 9
I enjoyed this anime a lot. Never did I get bored watching it and most of the time I was stuck to screen sitting on the edge of my seat. But I have to say that once the episode was done I wasn't that reluctant to go watch the next episode, because there wasn't an overarching plot that would connect from one episode to the next.

Overall: 9
The best part about Cowboy Bebop was the music and animation. The production value for this anime was very high even for nowadays standards. I have to say that I didn't like the story that much because I found it cliche a bit and the characters even though cool and pretty much realistic they didn't really relate to me. But also I must admit that this anime has something that you really can't categorize and that is style. And that style just makes all those bad things I said about it almost meaningless.

I would recommend this anime to every anime fan and even to people that haven't seen any anime, because it has a lot of good qualities that could interest non-anime people into watching it. As for those people who care more about the stories morals and what it has to tell you about everything I would not advise you to jump in watching this anime with high expectations, because Cowboy Bebop is more about style over matter.

    Cowboy Bebop is one of those things that has not aged well. Not because it wasn't a high quality, groundbreaking show that helped to define the genre, but BECAUSE it helped to defined the genre. I'll say now: I didn't grow up with this show. By the time I got around to watching it, I was about 20 and have seen these formulas and characters over and over again. Did Cowboy Bebop do it first? Probably not. Did they do it well? The popularity suggests they did it very very well.

However, over the years people have used this formula so many times that it has

          
        fallen into a cliche. To someone watching it (without nostalgia value) everything is predictable and gets painfully boring painfully fast. There wasn't anything shocking in it, nothing I couldn't see happening 5 episodes beforehand, and every character was one I had seen a million times before and wasn't interested in seeing again.

If you're asking me for specifics on what I didn't like, I can't even give that many. It was, for me, a totally forgettable experience.  While I would never deny someone their nostalgia, I'd warn newer viewers to check out something a little more fresh.

    In my mind, Cowboy Bebop is the perfect show for people you know who say "Anime? What are you, 12?" 

It's slick, it's funny, it's serious, and it knows how to avoid anime stereotypes. It has characters that you'll never get tired of, plot twists that will keep you watching up late at night, epic fight scenes, and a soundtrack that is worth shelling out for.

With that said, let's roll.

Story: 9

Though it wanders on occasion, I'd like to say that nearly 100% of the time it's to develop characters further or to add a bit of humor. The Star Trek parody episode was a bit

          
        over the top (but enjoyable), and to me it's hard to enjoy enjoy the filler episodes as much as the ones where sh*t really gets real. But let's delve into those. WOW. The last two episodes of the show are as good as it gets in anime. Not to mention the 5th episode, or the back-to-back ones that take place on Mars. I won't ruin any story elements, but look forward to these. If you take anything from this review, take this: those 5 episodes are worth watching over, and over, and over, for any anime fan.

Art: 8

It's tough to write a review now for a show that took place as long ago as it did, but I'll give it a shot. It's well drawn, and well animated, but it's nothing mindblowing. I remember seeing the first episode fight scenes and being thoroughly impressed, but for me the main draws of the show were always the music, the characters, and the story. I can't say I've ever been much of an art critic, but for the most part is was aesthetically pleasing. I was certainly impressed by the character design, and the world that the artists created was both interesting and desirable. 

Sound: 10

Yoko Kanno honestly outdid herself this time. In all my years of watching anime, this is the first time I've really felt like I NEEDED the soundtrack. Great OP, great songs throughout, great everything. So impressed with what she did here.

Character: 9 

How can you not love Spike Spiegel or Faye Valentine? They're the ones that you'd like to be in real life. To me, it's not just how badass the characters are, it's the ideals they represent. Honor, bravery, and an unwillingness to let anything stand before something that you know in your heart is right. The only comparison that I can make here is a show called Firefly, which isn't an anime but in some ways reminds me of Bebop. Great design, great execution, and I wouldn't get sick of any of them even if the show went on for 100 eps.

    Story 6/10

I mean it is not a bad story but is it really that "great"? A bunch of bounty hunters and a kid link up to go on adventures together while exploring a rather bland world set in space. The stories (episodes) could have been more exciting, with more plot twists, big reveals and emotionally driven. Frankly it was too straight forward for me to consider it anything amazing.

Art 8/10

For a 90s anime it has aged very well. The spaceships are very unique and the environment represent space travel dystopian suited to its time.

Sound 9/10

At first I was like "this OP is garbage and ED

          
        is okay". Then as it went on, I discovered the soundtrack within the episodes to be the best part of the series for me personally. The songs are varied, the instrumentals are atmospheric and certain tracks fitted with the scenarios perfectly. Although I warn you, I only started to appreciate it later in the series.

Character 6/10

I think I would have touched a nerve with scoring the characters this low but  they are mediocre. They are not particularly interesting when you compare them to something like One Piece where every character whether side or main are filled with so much personality. Spike is cool, Ed fluffy, Faye feisty and Jet a boring old man but these are pretty one dimensional (with interesting backstories I guess). But nothing about them gripped me, maybe they were too "ordinary".

Enjoyment 7/10

Now I'll go into detail of what I enjoyed and didn't.

As mentioned briefly, the adventures are not that exciting besides Spike episodes. Luckily he got the most screen time. 

Then we hit episode 12 and everything became a little more interesting with Faye's back story just starting then my interest tailed off again. By episode 20 I was a bit discouraged to finish it. Due to its episodic nature you are literally judging episode by episode. One minute it's interesting next minute it's average. It depended on the character in focus a lot of the time. Spike and Faye would captivate me briefly then Jet and Ed would bore me (bar the mushroom episode with Ed was fun).

Although, it ended very strongly - Episode 24 left me with a weird feeling. Seeing that certain characters were potentially leaving made me feel sad. I can't remember when my attachment to them creeped up on me but it just did. The sound track had placed it's role perfectly.

So the last few episodes were great. Suddenly everyone opened up about their true feelings and suddenly the characters came to life. But it was too little too late, it was not worth all 26 episodes. I would have rather just watched Spike/Faye related episodes or a movie that summarised it all.

The Anime does very little wrong. It doesn't engage in fan service or annoying anime tropes. Everything feels authentic and true to itself. If you enjoy the characters interactions you will enjoy the episodic nature and that's the problem. It's episodic so there's no bigger story or world building to keep your imagination turning. There's nothing to get your heart racing, no complex theories to chew over, no back stories to pull your heart strings (wait Faye's nearly had me but they didn't go deep enough!). 

It's just every day life in space, well written with just the right amount of action. But I personally don't watch anime for this laid back sort of shows.Thus the wow factor didn't rub off on me. It didn't excite me enough. If I wasn't marathoning it, I doubt I won't anticipate an episode. I'll simply tune in if I had a spare moment.

    I will get heat for saying this is how I truly feel. Cowboy Bebop is good but overrated for me. First of all, the characters, artwork, music, sound effects were absolutely incredible and way ahead of it's time. SHOUT OUT TO THE THEME SONG!!!! But the story just didn't do it for me. The main villain I felt was not developed enough to make me care about him and it's because of this, the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist just didn't resonate. I will say the final episode was very well done and entertaining but in the end, I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied

          
        by the whole show. I can't say in my right mind that I'd recommend it to everyone. For people who love episodic shows, this is as close to heaven as you can get. But for some that don't love that sort of format, I'd recommend to at least give it a shot as there is some high quality material to be found here. In the end, it was still an enjoyable experience and that's why I give it a 7.

    As a fairly new anime fan I obviously started with some of the most recommnded shows, and Cowboy Bebop was one of the first. This show is considered a masterpiece thanks to the alleged fascinating characters, outstanding story and amazing music. 

Let's start with the latter- the Jazz soundtrack is really cool, though not notable or memorable in most of the parts. The openening theme is super cool, and I almost never skipped it (a thing I usually do). 

The show has a nice background story- after an accident in the hyperspace the Earth became uninhabitable, and humanity colonized the other planets and moons of

          
        the solar system. Meanwhile, crime rates have risen, and bounty hunters help the police catch criminals. In short- a fair setting for a space western. There are indeed some beautiful views and space battle scenes in here. 

The problems begin when the story starts being told. First, like most in of the shows in which the episodes' plots aren't tightly connected, troubles tend to get fixed to quickly. A more major problem is that the first 10 episodes are absolutely boring! If the show wasn't considered a must-watch classic that luckily has only one season, I probably wouldn't have gone past them. The 11th episode is a turning point in the manner of the plot quality, altough such episode was probably made in every show with a spaceship ever. 

But eventually, the biggest cause for my personal relative unenjoyment was the thing that the show is most praised for- the characters. It is true that all the main characters have mysterious troubled pasts that are explored throughout the show. However, because we know nothing of them at the beginning of the show, and their backstories are revealed way to slowly, I couldn't find even a small piece of interest in any of the characters until the very last episodes. For example, Jet's past which was the first to be revealed, is actually quite an uninteresting unoriginal cliche. Around episode 20 I realized that my favorite character is actually Ein the dog! Combining that with the boring first 10 episodes, I got a show that I would likely drop in an early stae unless I was feeling obligated to watch it until the end as a so called classic. 
Also, I was really bothered by the unproportional bodies of Spike and Faye, or more specifically- their extermely long legs.

    Cowboy bebop is probably the most influential piece in the history of anime.
I guess i'm the one being played now. 

This is elegant, stupidly elegant! It just REEKS masterpiece. OH MAN. And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack. It is just such a shame 'The Seatbelts' split up after only a few bebop related projects. Japanese jazz is mastered here, it only took 40 years after the genre peaked in some anime. Weird that. 
Eccentric Charles Mingus-esque bop and post bop is beautifully paired with extravagantly smooth folk and blues remnants. 'Jupiter jazz' and 'Space lion' will forever be this anime's masterpieces. 

Cowboy bebop, especially, can

          
        boast a tasteful blend of western and eastern styles of film, it never really takes itself too seriously. Do I need to speak about the writing? These characters are too charismatic for their own good, in life and death they exemplified perfection, Spike especially. Consistency would have awarded this piece a 10.

You're Gonna Carry That Weight. 
The weight that is at once the load of our past and also the promise and burden of unrealized hopes and aspirations for the future - the future Spike never had a chance with. As Shinichiro Watanabe once revealed about this line taken from the last Beatles's album, "The meaning behind that phrase, since the Beatles took a lot of weight from the fans, was that the fans had to now carry that weight."
This short series of 26 sessions has been nothing short of an immaculately conceived dream. The Bebop takes us on a joyride but sends us back with an encouraging lesson: while Spike is no longer able to carry the weight, we, whose lives and dreams continue, can. - [ Leigh ]

No piece can boast of such a mastery of sound and characterization in the history of anime. I definitely felt that weight.

    Frankly, I'm not sure how I can do a show like Cowboy Bebop justice in reviewing it in such tiny space. I think Cowboy Bebop is absolutely a product of genius. I think genius minds conceived and executed the concepts, story, and production of this series, and I believe it will always mean a great deal to me. I say this with the utmost concern for nostalgia and trying to disappate it, judging the show by its merits and not for the time at which I watched it and how radical it was at the time, but rather for what it continues to be based

          
        on its true merits. 

For one, I can see why others may dislike elements of the show, but those are the same elements I think are justified. The show is episodic, yes, but rather than being a bunch of completely unrelated adventures that just feature the core cast in different situations, the episodes are more like a series of short little films that each reveal a little more of the bigger picture, not necessarily of the main underlying plot, but something much more important, which is the world and atmosphere, the environment and attitudes which are pervasive in the show. The very lives of the characters are "episodic", but an episode rarely ends without having made some headway in unveiling more of the tapestry of this world the characters live in. 

The main plot, the plot of Spike's past with the Red Dragon, that's something that keeps together the threads, but ultimately only exemplifies- well, perhaps more than that, epitomizes- the grander attitude of the entire work. Given more time to breath, perhaps a more traditionally strong narrative would  have worked its way out, which is probably the only flaw I can find with this show. However, it's barely a flaw, because it serves as a great and tragic sword of Damocles over the throne of the viewer. However, unlike that sword, it does certainly strike, and surely, and with consequence. 

The production values are quite breathtaking, some still by today's standards. The music is especially spellbinding. The show is very stylish, and so more cynical folks may be lured into believing the show is "style over substance", but the style becomes part of its substance, much in the way a Tarintino film both indulges in and skewers pop art culture. 

It's a show that feels almost as new every new time I watch as it did the first time. Sure, now I've been exposed to several anime that closely rival its greatness. But none of them quite manage to match or surpass it. 

Cowboy Bebop is a stellar series. Perhaps the most representative of what anime can accomplish, It is both entertaining and provocative. It's a rousing jazzy ballad of the bizarre and the sorrowful. It's a must see for anyone.

    This was the first anime I ever watched that made me completely re-evaluate what was possible in an animated medium. Not only that but despite the improvements in computers and technology that have allowed anime to become more visually astouding, cowboy bebop managed to achieve the same levels of detail and motion of modern anime over a decade ago.

Do not approach cowboy bebop as being anime. It is animated, but really it is more like live action then a cartoon. The creators of this show did not skimp when it came to fully animating fight scenes, space battles, or even some of the more idle

          
        moments. There is never a moment where footage is recycled or cheesy backgrounds go flying by while characters strike a pose, nor are there any chibi or emoted moments.

Cowboy Bebop is also best if not rushed through, there IS an overall story arc, but most of the episodes are self contained, and do not really require rapid succession. Also when you complete this anime you will surely feel that the show is concluded, and that a sequel or serialization of the series is unnecessary. This show is good enough to re-watch and still find the same enjoyment as the first time you saw it.

Usually its difficult to fully decide how to rank anime since there are many ways to do it, such as by overall plot (i HATE cop-out endings which are typical of most shows.. curse you school rumble!), quality of art/animation/ visual excellence, music, voice talent, dub (if applicable), characters/character development, and something that is sometimes neglected is depth (how much do you have to allready know to fully enjoy an anime). However, Cowboy Bebop excels in every one of these areas, so it makes it easy for me to give this show 10's across the board, it truly is a masterpiece, and is not as difficult as EVA to fully appreciate, as it does not require you to wikipedia info on Jewish Mythology, Kabalism, Sephiroths, ect. and can be watched in English without sacrificing any aspect of the show, which also makes this show a great candidate for newbies to serious (non serialized) anime.

ON A SPECIAL NOTE:
Yoko Kanno is quite possibly one of the greatest film composers, and wrote a ludicrous amount of FULL LENGTH music for this show. If the quality of the anime isn't enough to get your rocks off there are about 8 cd's worth of top notch music, (mostly jazz, blues, and gospel) all origional work composed for this series which I also recommend to you audiophiles. The Seatbelts are awesome...

    So, I know almost everyone loves this show to death, but honestly I in no way can understand the hype. Cowboy Bebop is, probably, the worst anime I have ever seen in my life.

Story - 1
First of all, there is no story. The show is episodic, which isn't always a bad thing, but Cowboy Bebop does each individual episode's story so poorly. Every episode basically goes the same way. The crew catches a cheap bounty showing how "cool" they are. Then, one of the members meets some suspicious stranger, who, surprise, ends up having a bounty on their head. As the episode moves on, we

          
        learn that the criminal isn't actually a bad person, and that they've just been put in a rough situation. A final confrontation takes place, and the criminal dies at the end. Every now and then there are special character episodes, which change up the formula a little bit, but then the consequences to these stories never show up again. 

Art - 6
Art was really bland. The colors are boring. Animation was smooth. But then again it's easy to make animation smooth when almost nothing happens.

Sound - No Score
I don't listen to music because I spend all my time watching anime, so the whole music aspect of the show was lost on me. 

Character - 3
The characters are so boring and simple. Spike is the typical "cool" character because he never has to put any effort into what he's doing. His backstory, which is seemingly one of the big pulls of the show, is so cliche that it becomes boring and a waste of time. I would criticize Jet's character but I really don't know enough about him because he's never developed, except for one random character episode that is supposed to make us feel sorry for him or something. Faye is just for fan-service and is boring. Meanwhile Ed is just there. She doesn't contribute anything except weird comic relief. Overall, the characters are so boring and the relationships between them are even more boring. The characters rarely actually interact with each other. The only time I was ever actually interested in the characters was around episode 10 during Spike's character episode. There was clear tension between the members of the crew, and that actually had me interested. However not only did this tension come out of nowhere, it also disappeared just as instantly as it was created. 

Enjoyment - 1
Not a fun show at all. The action scenes are all incredibly boring. First of all they are just slow, and coupled with the fact that we know nothing serious is going to happen to the characters, there is zero excitement. 

Overall - 2
cowboy Bebop is a bad show, and as I said earlier I cannot understand why people love it. Every element of the show is boring and cliche. People might say that it is unlike any other anime out there, but in reality it shares far more than it may seem. Like most anime, every character has a "tragic" backstory. These backstories also are randomly introduced and randomly vanish over the course of one or two episodes. Also this show is filled with fan-service, which people seem to just not have a problem with in this anime for some reason. Cowboy Bebop is only unique in the sense that no one on the show does anything unique or interesting.

    I,ve been hearing a lot about how Cowboy Bebop is so unoriginal and that there are way more better anime out there but they are wrong, there is nothing else to it they are just plain wrong and here's why.

Story 9/10 this part I can understand a little bit because the show has an episodic manner and then it get's into a story at the end and some people say that the rest of the show was a waste but if the show was about the characters trying to get to the end the show would have been much worse everyone says that all the

          
        episodes are the same but when I rewatched it I realised that none of the episodes were the same,there was this one user who said that all the episodes were like an example that he gave and he perfectely described 1 episode, none of the other episodes were like that.

10/10 The art is also one of the most outstanding things about the show, all of it was so smooth and interesting and everything was slightly shaded to compliment the tone of the show.

Sound 10/10 The sound and the music are beyond perfect for the show because the hole show is in the future but the nice jazzy guitars and harmonicas make the show set like a western and they go perfect with the show. Not to mention the opening is kick ass.

Characters 10/10 A lot of people say that the characters are cliche and boring but they,re all good, Everyone says that Spike is your average cool guy but why is that bad? You litterally just insulted someone by saying that they,re cool and Spike is more than just cool he is skilled at martiwl arts and he has many funny and cool one liners to make his character loveable. Jet is good but people say that he doesn't have character devellopment but Cowboy Bebop is not about character devellopment, it,s about peopke who have been through character devellopment and they are just living out their lives.

Enjoyment 10/10 The show has many interesting stories anda ridiculous amount of amazing scenes the action is cool the one liners are epice and/or funny and the show never lets you down on any episode.

Overall 10/10 Cowboy Bebop is the best anime of all time and if you don't think so then you have shit taste.

    This anime is an icon and an inspiration.

The anime is revealed in episodes, with each episode having its own story with occasional flash backs (for character development) in between. It is simple and easy to understand. Each episode is so perfect that it is able to provide some brief history about the events that occurred as well as cover the current happenings. The episodes also have nice combination of some light heartened and emotional moods. The endings are quite satisfying (in general manner).

The art is bit dull but it fits in showcasing the anime as western style anime. Characters are well defined with each having

          
        its own unique features which match their personality. The background details like vehicles, planets and space stations across the anime do not diminish in quality.
The animation is very fluid given it is a decade old and no digital tech was not used.

Voice acting is wonderfully performed as it properly matched with the personality of characters and the emotions they show. The music in the anime involves jazz, blues, classic rock which gives awesome emotional detail to given situations. The opening theme TANK is one of the main features of the anime. It gives an idea of what expect in the anime. And just listening it creates eagerness for the show.

Each character in this anime is at height of cool in their respective areas (personality wise) thus making them memorable. Spike is a bounty hunter, martial arts specialist and awesome pilot. Jet, earlier a cop and now head of the bebop crew, he is somewhat like guiding figure for others. Faye is an independent, stylish woman with a bad habit of gambling. Edward is a genius child from earth whose presence create situation light hearten. Their way of working out the circumstances together given their diverse backgrounds is most interesting to watch. Characters also have to face their past which shows how they react to situations which are sensitive to them. And they do it quite well.

Cowboy bebop is truly amazing amine with all the right mix of characters, story, and animation thus being among the best anime of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.

    As a child, Cowboy Bebop was an animation that "I didn't get"; it was focusing on a much bigger picture that wasn't tied to explosions and intense action. Now as an adult and rewatching the series. I am convinced that it is one of the greatest animation/shows ever made. There is a mastercraft work of how this show delivers its ideas and characters that we often overlook or take for granted today. The main character Spike Speigel is no superhero or beefed up multi-colored character, but rather a cocky, lazy and sometimes efficient bounty hunter. The brilliance in this setup however is that Spike feels

          
        more human and relates more to me than any character in animation I have yet to see. His past and his attitude all reflect a sort of Han Solo anti hero style that makes him compelling to watch. Of course Ein, Edward, Valentine and Jet are also great characters to watch too as their backstories give just enough to wet the palate of your imagination and leaves them open ended for you to decide for yourself what their lives are like.

In a world where anime can take to monstrous heights and commitment where watching hundreds of episodes can be a huge deterrent for newcomers, Cowboy Bebop only comprises of a single season and carries far more impact and power than any I had watch even now. This is not to overshadow other shows that have their own moments, but to see something so short get so much right is why some, myself included, consider it a masterpiece. The opening is iconic and really is one of the best intros to any show (including non-anime) that you could ever have, with jazz and blues mixed and with a touch of this Wild Western grit that really hooks you right in. 

Of course there are always flaws to every show and this one is no exception. While the artwork and design is still strong overall, there are some animations that have seen age and can be a bit silly despite a possible serious tone. Not every episode has the same quality (which all still rank above well done anyways) given so it's a matter of looking far more into the themes and concepts to take more from it. Aside from some nitpicks, the show still remains a staple to animation done at it's peak. 10/10s are often misunderstood by people as "perfect" but nothing truly is; it's just a representation of how a craft is fine tuned to deliver compelling pieces of art and characters that we take away from. A gigantic explosion will always be trumped by a finger gun by a dying man as he shows his last cocky attitude to the viewer. 

Cowboy Bebop is outstanding in it's entirety. Nothing is weak or dull for a single episode. The characters and their backgrounds are all wonderfully interesting and have a huge sense of relativity to ourselves. We often see anime show teens that fight for their emerging adulthoods and being as changed people. Cowboy Bebop shows adults that don't change and the struggles of living in such a world that it makes it even far better. Watch this animation, there is a sadness and yet engrossing tale to be told that is outstanding in every sense of the word.

    The Music: Jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country funk. Yoko Kannos' work is pure genius.(You might also be aware of her work from The Ghost in shell series)

From the opening theme song "Tank", to chase sequence music such as "Bad Dog No Biscuit", to "Space lion" or the awesome "What planet is this?". The music is pitch perfect and suits the setting of the anime elegantly.

The Characters: Cowboy Bebop's characters are as realistic a one can get. What is great about the series is that it maintains the mortality of main characters. This team is not a bunch of all powerful god like super-humans

          
        who can kick anyone's ass simply by their "will power"   (Goku..cough cough..Naruto cough cough...Shonen cough cough)
This team is all too real, they have their problems, they can be overpowered and they can die.

The Voice Actors: I have never seen another anime which compares to the same level of English dub as this this series, okay maybe Baccano!
The voice actors used have done a really really good job. I just cannot picture Spike Spiegel without Steve Blums' voice in my head.
I mean really, one of the best dubs evaaarr.

The Bruce Lee element: Chances are you find Spike Spiegel's fighting style jaw-dropping awesome. Have you ever wondered what what type of style is that?
It's Jeet Kun do which "is an electric/hybrid style of no style and philosophy of life founded by martial artist [The great]Bruce Lee."

That is not the best part. Not only is Spike practitoner of Jeet Kun Do but also follows Bruce Lee's philosophy of life.

Noir-CyperPunk-SpaceWestern: Holy shit, this anime has all three of them. The technology depicted in the anime is fascinating probably because it still uses wires which gives it an interesting aspect because we all know the future will be nothing like that.


Humor: Cowboy Bebop is anything if not funny. The classic Spike and Jet situations are very humorous. Not only that, the recurring characters such as the three old men, and Punch and Judy from the T.V show Big Shot can put a smile to anyone's face.

For me Cowboy Bebop has evolved beyond as an anime. It is a culture.

    Short Review: (I know, I know, I gave Cowboy Bebop less than a 10/10) Almost everything about this anime is of extremely high quality, especially considering we're talking about an anime that's more than 15 years old. Pitch-perfect English dub, a vast bout incredible OST, unique characters, and incredibly fluid animation. HOWEVER. I did not expect an episodic story, and this led me to almost hate the anime at times. 

Looooooooong review: 
Story:
Before watching this anime, my expectations for Cowboy Bebop were astronomically high, pun somewhat intended. Having known this cult classic's reputation, I was sorely disappointed to find out Cowboy Bebop is an episodic

          
        series, something that was conveniently left out in every review I had come across (I don't really like episodic shows). I was expecting this epic space opera tale filled with drama and complex characters, which Bebop only fully delivered the latter. A lot of this anime's story goes something like, "There's a new bounty on a criminal!" "Let's catch him/her!" Stuff goes wrong, fights ensue, then things look up, the problem is (somewhat) solved, and in the end, the crew gets (almost) nothing. Episodes that do not involve trying to catch a criminal usually involve the antics of one of the crew members, something which the writers must have had a lot of fun coming up with. Occasionally, some other stuff is sprinkled in, mostly involving someone/thing from one of the crew's past. This is where the main theme of the show comes in, as every crew member gets at least 1 episode dealing with their past and how they handle it. This method of storytelling left much to desired from me, because for every great and very enjoyable episode, there was one that made me feel very annoyed and facepalm a lot. And there were only about 10 "plot" episodes in the whole series. However, the anime did keep me interested by ending the episodes in a way that most people wouldn't expect. This was probably the most interesting part of the show. The narrative of Cowboy Bebop does not ever do the "info dump" many sci-fi series are guilty of. Because of this, the writing may seem "masterful" but for me, a few times I spent the first few minutes of an episode wondering just what was going on. Once again, maybe I just wasn't "mature enough" for this anime. Cowboy Bebop makes the unique genres of Space Western and Neo-Noir work together exceedingly well, which is probably what contributed to this anime's popularity. As for the ending, I don't think I could have written a better ending to this anime. It's just one of those where it lightly hangs in the air, waiting for its full effect to sink in. It felt like everything was tied up in the story, but not in the "fast-forward" way others shows end.

Characters:
I do give praise to the characters in Cowboy Bebop, as every one of them is unique and not lazily written. They all have their deep motivations for why they do what they do, and it's usually isn't a cliche reason. The best part about this is as you see more about the characters, it becomes more interesting to watch their dynamic, them growing and reacting to their surroundings, because everyone is so non-cliche. Every member of the Bebop crew is very likable and has a fleshed-out personality, with Spike being effortlessly smooth and cool, Jet being a (reluctant) voice of reason, Faye being the strong female lead with no romantic feelings for Spike (shocker), and Ed being ridiculously enigmatic and childish, but never annoying. Even Ein had his moments of being very necessary to what was going on throughout this anime. It's because everyone aboard the Bebop is so different from one another, this rag-tag team feeling did push the story into many great moments and episodes. They highlight each other's flaws, but also make each other stronger, despite all their bickering. Secondary characters are usually in only one episode each, because this is an episodic series. Characters siding with our protagonists usually change by the end of an episode, and the "bad guys" were all unique, mostly memorable, and fun to watch get chased down by the Bebop crew. The real bad guys, Vicious and the Red Dragon syndicate, made interesting antagonists, despite their roots in western movie cliches. They were threatening, but not enough that it becomes the focus of the show. All the character designs were both unique and creative, which brings me to my next point...

Art:
I really do have to tip my hat (if I was wearing one right now) to the art style of this anime. It's very 90's, while having its own unique style. Yes, it very much looks like anime, but the style is also westernized, blending the two in a beautiful harmony. The one thing that Cowboy Bebop really left an impression on me is that the art (actually, most of this anime) is undeniably stylish and unique. I really loved how all the sci-fi elements looked gritty and realistic, while the aspects closer to present-day were incredibly detailed, almost as if the animators took real buildings and setting and transformed them into anime. The art perfectly blends the western and sci-fi elements in a way I would have thought would never have worked. 

Animation:
Cowboy Bebop is one of the last anime series to be made entirely by traditional cel animation, drawing each and every single frame by hand. But for it's time, the animation is incredibly fluid and consistent throughout the entire series, something which was a problem for other shows using the same animation method (cough Evangelion cough). Heck, I'd even say the animation quality of Cowboy Bebop is equal to, if not greater than some of the stuff that's being made today, 16 years later. All the action is as effortless as Spike's fighting style, and the animators took great care in making sure everything in this anime looked realistic, somewhat gritty, and absolutely amazing. Only very few clips of recycled animation were used, and the only ones I can think of are when the Bebop flies through hyperspace and those yellow gates. Clearly Cowboy Bebop had a large budget, and it was used to its full potential by not skimping on animation.

Voice:
This is a no-brainer, but I say watch Cowboy Bebop dubbed. Part of the reason this anime is so famous here in the west is because of its amazing dub. While it actually took me a few episodes to get used to the voices, especially when a new member of the crew was introduced, the dub quickly grew on me, but did did hit a few bumps in the road here and there. Steve Blum is probably most well known for playing Spike, and the same can be said about Wendee Lee playing Faye. All the voice actors clearly had a lot of fun dubbing this, and they gave it their all and it payed off. The script is witty, the delivery for all the actors was (95% of the time) pitch-perfect, and added to the style and overall feel of the anime. The dub just feels so much more stylish, while reading subs usually just give you the raw translation. With a western prime audience in mind, Bandai made sure this dub was of the best quality, and it is one that is considered the best dubs in all of anime. Even Shinichiro Watanabe, the Japanese director, says the English dub is better. 

Music:
The opening theme, "Tank!" has lent itself to be one of the most iconic anime openings of all time, being a) instrumental and b) as stylish and jazzy as the rest of the show. In case the title of this anime didn't clue you in, almost the entire soundtrack is inspired from jazz or classic western movie music. Even some of the episode names are classic American rock songs (Bohemian Rhapsody) or albums (Toys in the Attic). Yes, this does lend this anime "cool" points, but the sheer number of tracks in the OST (93!!!) means that you won't hear a lot of them very often. There are a few exceptions, like the music box theme whenever Spike's past came up. Some songs are slow, some are quick, some are sad, and some are kinda goofy. Yoko Kanno has proven that she can compose a completely amazing soundtrack, and this is one of her most famous works. The first ending theme actually wasn't that impressive, but the second ending theme, used only for the last episode, had my mouth gaping open by how it matched the tone of the show's ending perfectly. It very much reminded me of "The World of Midnight" from Black Lagoon.

Execution:
I failed to recognize while I was watching this anime that it was designed to appeal to a western audience with its episodic storytelling and not being like typical anime of the time. While most seasoned anime fans and critics regard Cowboy Bebop as a "cult classic," the two words I would use to describe this anime are stylish and westernized. I don't think Cowboy Bebop necessarily failed, I just went in with the wrong mindset and impressions of the show. In other words, Cowboy Bebop's reputation precedes itself, but not by a long shot. Sure, this anime passes style with flying colors, but it seemed to me at first to lack the meat and potatoes, aka an overarching rich story. But I am one to agree this would make a good (but not the best) first anime and a great way to get fathers or brothers into anime. 

My Enjoyment:
Because I went into this anime with such high expectations, my enjoyment was hindered very much so. As I clicked on the next episode, I kept telling myself, "Okay, this is it. We're actually going to see some overarching plot or an entertaining episode." only to be disappointed 25 minuted later. I'm a bit hesitant to call this anime "overrated," but again, I just think my problem was that I went into this show with the wrong mindset. Sure, there were plenty of entertaining episodes, but there were more that had disappointed or just made me feel weird (not in the good way). The creativity involved for the more slice-of-life episodes is remarkable, but I can't help but feel a sort of grudge against this anime for "letting me down." Sure, I could go back and watch this series again (with the proper mindset) but I think my enjoyment of this series was ruined from the moment I caught wind of this anime's extreme reputation. Cowboy Bebop is the kind of anime to just pick up an episode or two, kick back, and relax. Enjoy the memorable characters, creative episodes, vast soundtrack, and the excellent dub. But don't watch it because "You're not a real anime fan if you haven't seen Cowboy Bebop hurrr hurrr." That is NEVER a good reason to watch an anime, and if anyone says something like that to you, tell them to shut up.

    There are only two anime series/OVA/movie I've seen.  Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist are the only ones.

Cowboy Bebop follows Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward as bounty hunters aboard the spaceship Bebop.  Now onto the many reasons why this anime series is perfect.

First the story:  Which blends comedy, drama, action, adventure, Sci-fi and even some romance perfectly like no other show.  Most of the series are one episode stories yet I think are all connected in the development of the characters.  The story of each individual episode is done perfectly giving a beginning a middle and end with no lose ends.

          
         The action is brilliant and I still haven't seen anything to compare to it.  Finally we have the last few episodes leading to the ending.  I won't give anything away to the people who unfortunately haven't seen this series, just it will blow you away.

Second the characters:  Again done perfectly.  Each character has their own unique personality who grows as the show goes along.  Spike who used to work for Red Dragon crime organization and his haunted by his past.  Jet a former police officer who is now working with a criminal, and his haunted by the mistake he made in the past.  Faye who awakes from a 54 year cryogenic sleep with no memory of her past, who lives for the moment.  Finally Edward a eccentric computer genius, who ran away from her father.  Each character brings life to the series and draws you in caring about what happens to each of them.

Third the animation:  The animation done by Sunrise is simply brilliant, and is still amazing after 10 years.

Forth the soundtrack:  The music to the series is the perhaps the greatest soundtrack to anime series ever.  It has a little of everything from Rock, classic, Jazz, Heavy Metal and others.  Each adding something extra to the series.  I even have the soundtrack to the series

Fifth the Influence:  Cowboy Bebop has Influenced many series much like Trigun.  Shows like BLACK LAGOON, SAMURAI CHAMPLOO, and others.  I think that's a great compliment.

Overall Cowboy Bebop is a perfect anime series and is must to any anime fan.

    The nonchalant Spike, The righteous Jet, The sneaky Faye, and witty Edward....

These beloved characters have in-printed themselves onto my heart slowly but surely.

CowBoy Bebop is an anime that was recommended to me by various sources. Knowing that the anime was about 14 years old, I was hesitant to start it up. Eventually, with the consistent nagging of my buddies and fellow anime fan, I started Cowboy Bebop.

Took me three days to marathon it, and boy what a ride it was!!

Story:

There only has been a few animes that were in a episodic style that I really enjoyed. Mushi shi was one, xxxholic was another, and I

          
        guess we can count Tsubasa chronicles as another. Besides those cherished anime, I have been left unimpressed by that style of storytelling. Little did I know that cowboy Bebop was the revolutionary anime that introduced this style to the animation world. Not only did it introduced, but it was executed perfectly most of the time.

There were episodes that I could have done without, some of the earlier episodes to be specific, and few random episodes in the mid section of the anime. This is not a problem since most the episodes were great and done a very aesthetically pleasing manner. 

The story in these episodes were less about plot and more about characters. These mini stories helped us understand and get to know the main characters in a unique manner. Nothing was handed to us, we had to decipher a lot of their backstory episode by episode, and we had to piece the stories ourselves.

In the end, however, everything came in a crash, and the entirety of these small plots came into a flashy dystopic climax!

Art/Animation:

The animation was flawless. Even without considering that this a show made 14 years ago, I was thoroughly impressed with the fluidity of every episodes. All of the fighting sequences left me breathless, and kept me at the edge of my feet!

The character designs reminded me a lot of Samurai Champloo...and I was pleasantly surprised to read that there are of similar origins, same director. 

I will add that this anime, out of all the animes that I've watched so far, had the greatest amount of diversity in terms of characters. It was not all just Japanese people who conquered and repopulated the universe but also Indians, Arabs, Africans, and Americans ( thinking of a certain cowboy hehehe)
I really enjoyed seeing this diversity because that is more representative of how the world actually is.

A lot of anime directors nowdays should take not of how to budget and direct these episodes, CB showed the way. This is how you get it done guys!

Sound:

Just like every anime review that I do, I stress the importance of sound/bgm as a contributor of the making of a masterpiece. Without a great accompany soundtrack, an anime cannot be called a masterpiece in my eyes. Sound sets the atmosphere faster than any of the senses that we have. It is of the utmost importance to have the best compatible soundtrack.

CowBoy Bebop doesn't disappoint on this end either. The soundtrack is strong. It is a mixture of different sounds from the sixties, a lot of jazzy records, and soothing blues. The soundtrack really contributes to the effects that CB is portraying, the smoothness of Spike, the sneakiness of Faye, and the tough righteousness of Jet are all represented well through the music. There are couple of pieces that I will later try to find for personal enjoyment. Really smooth soundtrack. 

Characters:

This anime is made by and for the characters. We don't have any ingenious plot line, or any non-fulfilling fan service...what we have is plenty of character development. Obviously, this is going to be the biggest part of the review since I will discuss in detail my opinion of each character.


Edward:      Is this a person a girl or a boy? The ambiguity of her gender plagued my thoughts throughout the show. Anytime I was convinced that she was a girl, someone would come along and challenge those beliefs. In all practicality, she was probably a girl. I really expected a lot from her when she was introduced, she seemed witty and smart, but also caring. She, however, did not live up to my expectations, probably becoming the least of the main characters in CB.

Faye:     I didn't enjoy her at first. She seemed too snotty for her own good. Usually characters of her type bring nothing but randomness and chaos to a story line, and I've never been a fan of that. She did surprise me around mid series however. She was a lot more deep than what I gave her credit for. Without delving into any spoilers, I found myself empathizing with her emotional distraught about her past life and ended up becoming a big fan of hers. I wish that she would have had more episodes where she was a bit more honest with her feelings, the tough girl act can only take you so far, but due to the 26 episode limit, I was thoroughly satisfied by the end with this character's development.

Jet:         My favorite character of the series. Jet is a balding middle age gentleman with a huge biceps and a big personality to follow along with it. At first, I thought he was going to stay one dimensional, usually characters of his type are not examined enough in anime, but again CB surprised me by giving me a glimpse of who Jet was in the past, and some of his reasoning. We saw him grow as he finally decided to not look to the past anymore, and I related a lot with that. A lot of the time, in my personal life, I've been tied to the past, whether it was a past version of myself, a past friend, a past job or school...a past lover....I found myself always looking back and reminiscing and it hasn't been until recently that I decided to put the past where it belongs, learn from it, and strive for the future. I love Jet because his development is an incarnation of the feelings that I've also developed. His friendship with Jet was unorthodox but really enjoyable to see. Sometimes, the people with opposite personalities find ways to become the closest of friends. Their constant bickering was like classical music to my ears, and their silence was brutally sad. They seemed to be really good at synchronizing with each other.

Spike:         The main character of the show, and the man with few words. Spike is a really interesting character because of his nonchalant attitude. It is really enjoyable to see him in action, he is so smooth in his fighting style that you are surprised by his efficiency. He is one smooth mamajama. His story intrigued me the most, I was really curious to know what his relationship to Julia was and why she was so important. Unfortunately, by the end, I didn't see why Julia was so important. It could have been better to maybe have separate episodes with just her, so we could understand better and empathize with who she was. Maybe it wasn't the director's intent for us to understand Julia but rather understand the emotional connection that Spike had with her. If that is the case, then yes, I did get that Spike really loved her...to the point that he would have died a thousand times to be with her. Spike was always indifferent to most situations, but any time Vicious, and Julia was mentioned he would go into ape mode or get moody. Nothing is wrong with that, but I would have liked further knowledge about that story line. I think if I rewatched the series, I would not recall these issues. All in all, I do like Spike as a character, he's funny, witty, and a good person at heart. A classy main character.


Side characters: Most of the side characters were just introduced and left in the same episode, very few carried over to other episode, and I guess that's the point of the episodic format. CB really did a good job of fleshing out these characters during the one shot episodes and making them deep and relatable. This wasn't achieved in all of the episodes, but it was well done in most.  

Enjoyment:

The episodes that I enjoyed....I enjoyed to its fullest extent, but the ones that I didn't like were really a drag. Those dragging episodes though were mostly in the first ten episodes. Overall, I really enjoyed the anime. 

I originally gave this anime an 8/10, which is a decent grade, but after taking into consideration the time period when this anime was made, I cannot downgrade the effort and care that was put into making it. I boosted it up to an 9/10...aren't I merciful? :) haha

Well, the anime wasn't the masterpiece that people made it out to be, I came in with super high expectations, but this was a great anime. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend anyone with a normal concentration span to try CowBoy Bebop out.

    After watching first episode, I thought this is just another episodic animes, which doesn't have any relation with one another. But it wasn't. It will take you by surprise, by how the story travels, how the characters relate, how the story is or the best of all, how the awesome sound gels with the story and give it a high value. I prefer this to any anime newcomer and I don't deny it will take them as a surprise.

Story: 8/10

The first few episodes you will feel like, is there any story at all. But I bet, it is, and damn what a story it is.

          
        At first glance, it is just another bounty hunter in alternate universe, but it so much more than that. And it is hard to explain without giving spoilers, so I contain myself not to reveal, but it is one hell of a story.

Art: 8/10

I was quite awestruck with the art style. Can't believe it came a decade ago, but nonetheless, it is refreshing. It is far better than lot of crap, that is being aired these days.

Sound: 9/10

One of the best OST in anime,I have ever heard. Don't go by my Anime List, I have heard a lot and it is easily one of the best. I seriously doubt this show would have received such accolades if not for the OST.

Character: 8/10

Characters are unique yet not so hard to understand. Each of the have nice back story which unfold over time. And all of them all excellent and it cruise along with the story. It compliments the story and does great job.

Enjoyment: 9/10

Damn, this anime has everything. Humor, Action and what not. I thoroughly enjoyed it and except a couple of filler episodes, I was totally blasted away with the show. I binge-watched the show after certain episode. as I couldn't wait any longer. It is seriously addictive.

Overall: 8/10

I enjoyed watching the show. Do I recommend it? Yes.

The storyline is great.
If you want to know if you're going to like Cowboy Bebop, I suggest to watch the first 4 episodes, they are a small introducing to the rest to the series. 

The story is about a space cowboy named spike, he is a bounty hunter on the ship the bebop. Together with Faye and Jet he collects bounty's, this isn't going that well all the time, therefore Cowboy bebop has a lot of humor, unlike most anime. 

The episodes selves are all different stories in one storyline, that's what makes Cowboy bebop unique. Every episode has got a lot of action

          
        in it, so it'll never bore you! It's really different from the other anime, but it's still good. 

All characters in the Bebop has his own backstory, which all get's unraveled during the series. 

I really enjoyed watching this serie and I highly suggest you to watch it. 
It has everything, again! Action, a bit romance, depression, humor and even horror (it's my opionon of horror ;))
So if you want a good anime, I suggest this one.

    Story: 8/10

A Series that was made in the late 90s and looking at that time where the anime was made, it had a quite interesting and nice story. The anime haves the old style of airing episodes, where almost every episode is for itself, just like in marvel shows.
Every single episode was really great in its own way. Some are really funny, some are sad and some are just epic and interesting. The cowboy + space combination was really great if you ask me. I totally enjoyed the story and was really sad because there wasn't more and not everything was explained. That is actually

          
        the only reason why i give it a 8 out of 10.

Characters 9/10

Characters in this anime are really great, not because they are "cool" or something. I'm talking about the different kinds of characters they made, and all of them special on their own and all them together make the perfect combination. The balance between funny/cool/sad and and and was perfect. I only wish i could learn more about every character, cause their individual story and past is such touching.

Music: 10/10

Giving it a 10 because i'm a huge Jazz/Blues/Metal fan and this anime had all of it. I was thinking that such music couldn't fit that great with anime, but it really can, and this anime is the proof for it.

Animation: 9/10

It was made in the 90's and for that, it had animations that are really nice made, from the movement of the characters to the fighting scenes and the surroundings, the space and the nature...it was all really nice to see and watch.
I respect them for making it with such quality even back then.

    Cowboy Bebop has something that the anime world has seem to have forgotten in a coinpurse somewhere: balls.

I don't mean just any kind of balls. I mean huge, sweaty, hairy testicles that swing back and forth like wrecking balls at the sheer hint of thigh movement. The atom-slicing power of these balls could level Detroit in a single blow. I'm not talking about the steroid ravaged, "mom where's the protein" balls of TTGL or G Gundam either. Those are anime you put on right after you inject yourself with bull-shark testosterone and deadlift 440 lbs. No, the balls Cowboy Bebop slaps on the table are

          
        of a different caliber; a different breed entirely, than the balls other anime, good and bad, have displayed in the past. They exude confidence without devolving into double-down, Long Island guido douchebaggery---they stand ice-cold in their manliness but aren't afraid to deliver one powerful scene after another. They aren't concerned with pretentious, Freudian mindfuckery, and they're past the "edginess" of gore, tits, and embarrassing profanity. There's no shitty gimmicks or pandering, and they don't let themselves fall victim to the stereotypes of what anime is supposed to be. Like Goku and Vegeta, or white people in Baltimore, they are the last of a dying breed.

Cowboy Bebop is an anime in the most basic sense of the word. In reality, it's a 26 episode, moving piece of artwork, taking influence from cultures in vastly different parts and time periods of the world. It's film noir, Chinatown style. It's The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, with Clint Eastwood's patented ice-cold asswhippery and Sergio Leone's masterful spaghetti western storytelling. It's 1930s New Orleans, Louisiana. It's Star Wars. It's Enter the Dragon. It's a culmination of the spiciest cultural influences from the far east to the shores of the west, and it's honestly the best experience with an anime you will ever have. Some people have a bone to pick with the episodic nature of the plot, but pay no mind to them. Each new episode is like a blank slate, individually developed and shaped into a unique piece; a miniature story that calls upon a fresh set of inspirations to give it a flavor all its own. The overarching plot of the show is subtle but existent; it draws upon all sorts of themes and motifs like love and revenge, and is quietly woven throughout the series until it finally takes precedence at the end. Despite this, the transition from standalone episodes to the overall story feels natural. Some shows force plot elements onto you like an American businessman on a young Filipino girl (ever see the second arc of Death Note?), but the progression here is cool Lester smooth. You can choose to take in the show however you want to---you can relish in the individual beauty of each episode or you can view the show as one coherent story, continually building off of itself. Either way, you end up with something that's completely genuine and one of a kind---there's no other anime like it.

While Cowboy Bebop isn't really associated with VIP quality artwork like it is with VIP quality soundtracks, Bebop has literally some of the best artwork in anime, ever. For some reason when you bring up the artwork from any pre-2000s anime, people get all condescending, like anything released before 2001 was drawn completely in purple crayon by Ms. Johnson's 8:30 AM kindergarten class. I've lost count of how many times I've heard stunning 90s animation cut down as "dated" by people that praise the emotionless, passionless digital animation of today. If anyone ever tells you Bebop's art is anything less than outstanding, punch them in the uterus for me. The animation is spectacular---the movement is surprisingly natural and the action is fluid. Watch a few of the fight scenes and you'll see why the creative staff of Naruto were reduced to ripping off one from the Cowboy Bebop movie, frame for frame. A lot of the character designs did away with traditional anime characteristics: bodies are proportional, even going so far as to downsize their usually massive eyes to a smaller, more manageable scale. The designs themselves are a treat to look at, and they fit the personalities of the characters pretty solidly. The action scenes themselves are varied, ranging the gauntlets from fistfights to dogfights and everything in between. If you don't think watching losers getting their shit wrecked is awesome, you will by the end of this show. Fuck, even the CG is good, if a little rough. The amount of detail Sunrise put into the animation is just, totally astonishing---even with the technological advancements of today it still takes a dump all over most of the artwork that's been put out in the past decade or so.

Now, again, Cowboy Bebop is associated primarily with its soundtrack. There's a particularly good reason for this, and it's because it's literally the best soundtrack you'll ever hear. While most anime, especially today, resort to typical gutter trash j-pop, the music of Bebop is an ensemble of jazz, blues, classical, funk, rock, with a little pop and even a little heavy metal. You get a nice introduction to what's in store from the OP---Tank is a kick in the ass and its only amplified by what's probably the best opening in all of anime. After an entire episode of fucking outrageous tracks, you close with The Real Folk Blues which is beautiful and totally melancholy. You will want to own every OST by the end of the show; other shows might have good music but I don't think I've ever seen a show with a soundtrack that's just as good if listened to like a regular old album. From Space Lion to Ask DNA, Yoko Kanno constantly hits it out of the park, and without her Bebop wouldn't have that signature vibe it's so well known for.

Also, the English dub is the best dub ever made. Period. If you watch this subbed you might as well kick yourself in the balls and set your computer on fire because you're depriving yourself of what is some of the best voice acting anime has ever seen. As much as I respect the Japanese voice actors and don't want to minimize their work, I don't even know what the hell they sound like because the dub is that fucking good. Trust me, even if you spit on dubs like they're a woman on the Maury show or a degree from ITT Tech, you need to give this one a chance. There is no weak link among the voice actors; every voice fits its character perfectly---every performance is Oscar worthy in its own right. It's honestly god-tier.

As for the characters, well, without them the show is nothing. Literally, the characters make this show. If you swapped them out for any other cast, the result would be a vastly inferior series about a group of douchebags on a gay spaceship who hang around shitholes and fuck with losers all day. Instead, what we're given is probably one of the most dramatic and artistic character pieces ever put to film. Each character feels like a living, breathing person, with their own faults and imperfections and checkered pasts. They don't just feel like plot devices for carrying a story along. The way they interact with each other and grow as people throughout all their exploits feels authentic and real, and their development over time is part of what makes Bebop so classic. Like real people, they constantly fight and bicker amongst one another but it's that bickering, and the experiences they have together, that draws them closer as a group. It's this approach to characterization that really pulls Bebop together as a whole---each character has their own story to tell and slowly, as you work your way through the series, you find out what those stories are. You have Spike, the smoothest, most ice cold motherfucker this side of the Milky Way, who brings a little humanity to the "live life in the fast lane and kick a shit ton of asses while you do it" lifestyle that he leads alongside his life partner Jet, who despite his ruggedness really serves as kind of a father figure to the group. Faye's past envelops her otherwise forward and strong personality, and Edward is just straight up goofy, but in an endearing way that actually makes you smile. Their trials and tribulations amongst each other and others from both their past and their present are entertaining, engrossing, and touching---again, without them, the show wouldn't be nearly what it is today.

I think the sheer quality and accessibility of this anime gives a lot of people the wrong idea, because I constantly see people recommending this as a great "first anime" for trying to get people into the medium. Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I saw, but I think using it as an introduction sends people the wrong message about what they should expect from most of the anime they'll see. Cowboy Bebop is a pinnacle in visual entertainment precisely because it's able to shed the typical "skin" of an anime and develop into something much deeper and more culturally rich. There's a lot of great anime out there, and the more anime I watch the more of it I discover. But starting with something so dissimilar to the majority of what anime is will give people a skewed perception of what anime should be right from the start. I guess this is the only way to get some people to sit down and actually watch a cartoon, but for others you're setting them up for disappointment down the road.

Enjoyment? It's the best anime I've ever seen. That's the only way I can describe how I feel about it. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (keyword you, I don't have tear ducts so I can't cry. Tragic accident, I don't want to talk about it). It'll make you think, it'll make you feel. It might give you a boner. It's untouchable. It's ice cold. It's a classic.

It's the best anime I've ever seen.

What makes an anime unforgettable? Characters, to be short and thick. Cowboy Bebop is one of the best animations of all time because, in its 26 episodes of 20 minutes each, it manages to reach the soul of the spectator in edges that the spectator himself was unaware of being possible to be reached, even more by a work designed. Shinichiro's anime has style - a lot of jazz! -, humor and drama pervaded by quality and especially of a tone of its own, standing out on any list of best anime and making it unique.
In this sense, the design owes much

          
        to its beautiful technical aspects. The animation of the action scenes, especially in Spike's fight scenes and in space duels, is breathtaking, especially given the year of the 1998 anime release. It goes so far as to outdo many (!) Current animations. Example of this soon sees in the first episode, where we know the style of the hairy and lazy Spike - an unforgettable image, although banal. Combining such quality with creativity in architecting an incredible range of scenarios, ranging from the most megalomaniac to the intimate.
My overhaul is 10 in any aspects, in anytime.

    First review here, new to MAL, and maybe not read that much. But still, allow me to give my point.

At the time of watching Cowboy Bebop, I was watching animes since a lot of time, and I was watching many at the same time. The kind of period when you were following more than the half of the series in a season. Finally I got tired of that, and the enjoyment was not the same. And then I wanted to watch Cowboy Bebop.

Why is Cowboy Bebop such a great anime? Why is it considered as a masterpiece? I wanted to know, I wanted to be

          
        part of it -if there was something to be a part of. But still, I couldn't forget Angel Beats. All my friends were telling me "man, it's so awesome". Well, check it out, it got only a 5 on my list. I'm not THE guy, but still, I was bored by this "masterpiece", or whatever my friends were telling me.

So what, I started Cowboy Bebop, let the magic do its stuff alright? So I was in. It's nice, I like it. I don't see any masterpiece here but hey, who cares, we'll see later. Oh the episode is already finished? Well, I played the second. And the third. And again and again. Watching the show wasn't that amazing. But I was so in it... When the last episode finished, I understood. I realized I watched something amazing. I haven't felt something like that since my first shots with series like Steins;Gate or Madoka.

Let me explain more: everything is just perfectly right, at the right time, with the right tempo and the best way to do it. It's not just something remarkable that you can point out, like SAO's first season is wonderful, but the ALO season is quite useless and really bad. Everything here is just fucking right (forgive me).

The story is wonderful, from the start to the end, including every background introduced. This is a point were old series can be boring, because the pace is slow, there are useless episodes. In Cowboy Bebop, forget it. Every episode is right, and the progression is really good. When you finish an episode, you sure want the next one. So it's a 10 I guess.
The sound is fantastic. Why? Because it's jazz and blues. What could be cooler than that? Seriously guys, the sound design is great, and the soundtrack is 20% cooler than any other. Go for it! And thank you Yoko, I love you.
The characters. Well, it goes with the story to me, mostly because each character has a good personnality, they understand each other, their interactions are right. They are deep, they smoke (oh my god they smoke it's so cool! I don't but it's so fucking cool!)... I don't know what to say, they're perfect! They just fit right in the global atmosphere of the show.

It's obviously an overall 10. No less. Because when you start Cowboy Bebop, you finish Cowboy Bebop. It's just amazing, and you have to realize it, at least when you finish it.

 Cowboy Bebop is a totally original anime, is not an adaptation of a manga, light novel or anything before, was written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and the director of the brilliant soundtrack was Kobayashi Katsuyoshi.

Story (8/10): Cowboy Bebop tells the story of four bounty hunters trying to make a living catching wanted criminals and handing them to the police. Cowboy Bebop works in a way different from others animes, no arcs or anything like that, each episode is a different story with different

          
        characters being added. Each episode they try to catch a wanted criminal or has a backstory of the main characters, there are some exceptions where the episodes follow in sequence with the 1st part and the 2nd part, the story is simple, however interesting, you see several different cases each episode and also the backstory of the main characters, but for me is the weakest point of the anime, because I prefer the division by arcs.

Art / Animation (8/10): considering that this is an anime 1998, the animation is very good and fluid, the well-designed characters and each very different from the other, not only in the characters design, the clothes too, action scenes are impressive too, very well made, in melee combat and also when they use firearms, speaking of fire, also very well done and lively, vibrant and bold colors, the smoke is also amazing, the space ships and design are also very good, the animation is very good indeed, but also has its small technical problems like all animation, but does not hurt one bit the experience.

Soundtrack (10/10): undoubtedly the most positive point of Cowboy Bebop, the soundtrack is jazz, blues and other popular music of the 80's and 90's, blends perfectly with the anime, sometimes the soundtrack is a bit of the old west style for a change, which is also very well made, the action scenes and especially in drama scenes you are impressed with such art work. It is truly a masterpiece.

Characters (9/10): I liked all the main characters, they are 
interesting, each with its strong and aggressive personality, taking Ed, she is very cute, spike is undoubtedly the most interesting, he seems unconcerned, but is more troubled by his past of the group, he is very skilled in melee combat, besides being a great shooter and also a talent with ships, Faye Valentine is extremely greedy and "selfish" always does everything to get along, but Faye inside is a child who does not know his past or "the place that she should return", she is not good in melee combat, but is good with ships fihts, Faye never had a intense gun battle to I evaluate his ability, but the little I've seen, she's good. Ed is just Ed, she's a hacker child who lived in an "orphanage" before being recruited to the Bebop, Ed is the typical noisy children, and live always hungry, Jet is the oldest of the group, owner of Bebop, who has a history with the police, but due to some events decides to become a bounty hunter, Jet always tries to be show the tough guy, but he cares a lot about his partner Spike, who lives just chasing his past and Jet does not agree with this, prefer Spike go ahead, Jet never had a melee combat, much less in a shootout, the to count on one hand the times he took action without I doubt the 2nd character with less focus i the anime, behind Ed.

Overall (9/10): 
I strongly recommend Cowboy Bebop if you like an anime with lot of action, drama, and a perfect soundtrack, undoubtedly an anime epoch and one of the best I've ever seen.

    The year is 2071. Humanity has long since expanded into space, with civilization taking hold in various ways on a large selection of the different rocky bodies throughout the solar system. Luckily, we were already in the middle of this process when a hyperspace gateway near the Earth exploded, leaving the planet in ruins and virtually uninhabitable. Its been fifty years since then, but we can still feel the effect of the disaster. Our colonies range from big, busy cities to smaller, less affluent townships that youd swear were taken right out of the old west. Interspace travel means nothing to most folk, who were

          
        born and raised and eventually expired on the same planet, hell, maybe even in the same town. Sure, those who chose the life of a transportation or delivery pilot may see a couple of different planets, and those rich enough to travel may have seen a few different sunrises, but if youve been everywhere, seen every shade of civilization, felt the grass and dirt of multiple planets beneath your feet, then youre either a criminal... Or a Bounty Hunter.

Yeah, it turns out that with so much ground to cover, the central government cant be bothered to uphold the law in every society, nor to keep up with wanted criminals who could be hiding out on any number of worlds. Thus, weve seen the rise of the registered bounty hunters, people whove taken on the job of tracking down and apprehending those with a high enough price on their head and delivering them to the authorities. Its a job that offers you freedom, excitement, and the right to be your own boss, provided youre successful enough to keep food on the table. Basically, its a job that appeals to those who would otherwise probably be outlaws themselves, real rough-and-tumble characters who just dont fit into normal society. This description couldnt possibly fit anybody more than the crew of the Bebop, a moderately sized vessel owned by a retired detective, that houses an ex-gangster, a femme fatale with a gambling problem, a psychotic child prodigy, oh, and also a dog. They may sound like a crew of rejects and shady characters, but with these cowboys on your tail, you might not even live to see prison.

Cowboy Bebop was produced by Studio Sunrise, a company thats been churning out anime since the seventies, and is still just as prolific today, with some of their more recent hits including Code Geass, Love Live, and the entire Gundam catalog. Bebop was one of their last projects in the nineties, but there are a few other notable benchmarks it holds. First of all, Bebop was the last project that several people working for the company would make before they parted ways, and formed their own studio, the incredibly popular and well-respected Studio Bones. Im assuming this split was an amicable one, because they were able to collaborate with their former parent company to make the Cowboy Bebop movie only a few years later. So yeah, the legendary production company that began in the 2ooos and is able to brag about producing both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, Soul Eater, Ouran High School host Club and Space Dandy, to name a few, and its greatest precursor was Bebop.

And the other benchmark? Cowboy Bebop was one of the final anime to be animated using hand-drawn cells rather than digital drawings. You would think this would be an indication of lacking visual quality, as the last efforts of one style before another takes over are usually somewhat pathetic... Just look at disco... But Cowboy Bebop is a glaring exception to that rule. Not only is it one of the best looking anime of the nineties, it holds up today as one of the best looking anime of all time. Yeah, when compared to offerings from todays market, Bebop definitely has a very retro feel to it, but since the series was originally designed to be retro, that just makes the aesthetic all the more timeless. The animation is unbelievably fluid, with action scenes that never have to break frames to look impressive, and space battles epic enough to warrant a comparison to early Star Wars. Even when the action does slow down, and the camera does linger on a shot, the artwork is beautiful enough... And the cinematography is smart enough... That youll never complain about what youre seeing.

The character designs are diverse, but human enough that everyone you meet... Aside from perhaps Ed and a certain balloon-like villain... Looks like someone that could easily be translated into real life, at least in terms of anatomy and facial structure. Their outfits are set to color palettes and styles that match their personalities while still remaining pleasing to the eye, and the backgrounds throughout are highly detailed. Episodes that take place in a western background are bright and welcoming, despite being broken down, dirty and weathered with time. Episodes with a more noir feel will take place in a tighter and darker environment, more shadowy and dangerous. Outer space is portrayed as expansive and empty, even when its filled with stars and debris. The use of color saturation and shading easily sells the tone and genre of any episode, and if youre watching the newly released blu-ray version of the series, all of the shows beauty is cranked up to eleven. And its not just the art style that enhances Bebops visual quality.

I feel like the best way to describe the music in this series would be to inform you that the musical composer of the series, Yoko Kanno, was also the inspiration for the personality and mannerisms of the character Ed, so try to imagine the kind of musical score that a film noir space western would have if it came from a wild, free-spirited genius with no respect for convention. Translation, its spectacular, possibly one of the best anime scores in the history of the medium. The score leans heavily towards jazz and the blues, and while the instruments that Kannos band The Seatbelts has available are diverse, theres an intense focus on trombones and saxophones, which in my opinion arent used enough in anime. It fits perfectly in Cowboy Bebop, as the aesthetic demands a funky sounding soundtrack, but the stuff they didnt do themselves... And thus the music that breaks from the series style... Are just as good. Theres a Steve Conte song called Call me call me, in one of the last episodes, that actually makes me cry, both in and out of context.

The most famous musical number from this series is probably Green Bird by Gabriela Robin, which is actually a false name for Yoko Kanno herself, which beautifully accompanies what little glimpses at Spikes backstory were actually allowed to see. A certain western sounding tune named Go Go Cactus Man is also noteworthy for heralding the appearance of a literal cowboy, and amusingly enough, Spike himself reacts to this tune when its played. Outside of the score, the sound design is also smartly used, with smaller unreleased musical pieces hyping up the tension and suspense of episodes like Toys in the Attic, but all of that pales in comparison to the shows opening and ending themes. Both are iconic in their own right, with Tank serving as the funky, undeniably catchy pump-up for some space-faring adventures, and the closing theme The Real Folk Blues serving as the power anthem that feels just right as the send-off to each episode, whether it was funny, serious or downright tragic.

The English dub, as Ive said before, has become something of a measuring stick, to which all other anime dubs must compare themselves to. Thats not to say I think its the best dub of all time... There are still three that I think have surpassed it... But there are plenty of fans and critics who will make that claim, and its completely understandable why. The dub was directed by Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn, one of the most respected names in the dubbing industry, and for good reason. She also played several small roles in the cast, including the mysterious Julia and one of the more memorable villains, environmental extremist Twinkle Maria Murdock. Her adaptive script is accurate and on-point, despite slight changes to appeal to a western audiences, and I have to point this out, there are very rare occurrences where an actor will slip up and fail to match the characters lip flaps. This barely ever happens, however, so its forgivable enough.

In terms of acting, all four of the main characters have become the most iconic roles of their respective actors. Steve Blum has been considered a legend in the industry thanks to his turn as Spike Spiegel, a laid back and lethargic louse who cares for nothing other than his next paycheck, except for those rare moments that hes made to care, either due to a resurgence of his past life or due to a fleeting chance at bringing some genuine good into the world. Beau Billingslea is a highly successful man in both his personal and professional lives, and hes also one of the only well-known black voice actors in the anime dubbing industry, thanks in no small part to his performance of Jet Black, a former detective and the cool, mature voice of reason of the Bebop crew. Wendee Lee is a bit of a hit-or-miss actor for me, as the quality of her work seems to fluctuate from project to project, but shes at her absolute best as Faye Valentine, a character who can be confident and duplicitous one minute but then vulnerable and emotionally raw the next.

Then you have Melissa Fahn, who somehow managed to bring more insanity to the character of Ed than even the original seiyuu Aoi Tada. Her crazy ramblings also include random tangents in Japanese, which she fires off smoothly. Together, the four of them form a bizarre sort of chemistry that never quite feels like a proper family unit... They feel more like coworkers, tolerating each other and accepting each others eccentricities as they strive towards a common goal. That common goal, mind you, is the money to survive, something essential and vital, but also entirely impersonal. Theres no bonding between these characters, no intricate relationships, no changing each others paths and arcs... The characters let their guards down and show vulnerabilities, but almost never around each other, and the English cast is just as good at portraying this as the Japanese cast. Add to this the hilarious contributions by James Penrod as the raucous Cowboy Andy and Lia Sargent and Paul St. Pete as the Big Shot TV hosts Punch and Judy, I do highly recommend this dub over its original sub.

Ive always said, when defining what is and isnt anime, that there really isnt any set of qualities that can be taken into account consistently. No matter what rule you try to follow, there will always be outrageous exceptions made. The only philosophy that really makes sense is Anime is made in Japan. But for the people who actually try to draw a dividing line between anime and cartoons, there are a few arguments I keep hearing about. The first is that theres an anime style. Big heads, giant tumorous eyes, small noses, exaggerated expressions... And another popular one is that anime is non-episodic, and tells a continuous story through plot progression and cohesive arcs. People will use these arguments as an excuse to call shows like Avatar and RWBY anime, and if you bring up shows like Shin-chan and Panty and Stocking, theyll argue that those arent real anime, and were designed to be more like cartoons.

But then you bring up Cowboy Bebop, a show that doesnt waste its time with stereotypical anime expressions, doesnt follow any alleged anime style, and for the most part, is episodic and full of filler. Its heavily adult in its presentation, despite the fact that it doesnt contain any gratuitous content... No giant boobs, no multi-episode fight scenes, no nudity or fanservice outside of a transexual dude and Faye occasionally sunbathing... No beach scenes, no hot springs episodes... Cowboy Bebop isnt like any other anime, even the ones that have tried to copy it in the 20 years since its release. The idea of there being an anime style is quite frankly bullshit, as thats a seriously reductive viewpoint on the medium, but arent the best anime the ones with engaging stories and involved plots? This isnt even close to the case with Cowboy Bebop, a show that did horribly during its initial release in Japan, so why is it considered one of the best anime of all time? Why is it still a mainstay on American TV over a decade later?

Well, theres actually some backstory on that. When Bebop was initially released, the studio that played it got skittish about how adult its content was, and wound up airing it out of order, with several episodes left out entirely. This didnt exactly build confidence with the audience, who werent even allowed to see the two best episodes, Ballad of Fallen Angels and Sympathy for the Devil. Keep in mind, this occurred in a country where that piece of shit Shadow Star was able to air on a Childrens Network. It was later run in its entirety on a less popular network named WOWOW, but the trouble its first network gave it provided a special kind of challenge for the series when it came to picking up steam. Heh, kinda reminds me of another series I know that got a lot of shit from its network, and was aired out of nowhere and treated unfairly by people who didnt know how to handle it... In fact, you know what? Back up a bit. This show has a lot more in common with Firefly than just its initial problems, and I think I can use the comparison to explain why both shows are so immensely popular despite having a short run and a disastrous debut.

There are plenty of similarities between Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, and considering the few things that the latter stole DIRECTLY from Outlaw Star, it wasnt very likely a coincidence. Both shows feature an old, beaten down spaceship that acts as a surrogate home for a crew of misfits, surviving day to day on whatever jobs they can take in order to keep food on the table and fuel in the tank. The focus is on character more than plot, and most of the cast has extensive backstories that translate to other lives theyve left behind, but are still haunted by. In both shows, Earth got used up, and humanity colonized the solar system, with no real aliens out there, and the territory is populated with an anachronistic array of settlements that the crew travels to and does business with. Firefly wound up being popular to this day for the same reason that Cowboy Bebop didnt get popular until it reached the states... Because its a story that was designed to appeal to an American audience.

Japanese society has always been deeply rooted in tradition and conformity. Its true that a lot of its art has made valiant efforts to challenge the norm, from Kill La Kills blatant attack on said values, and Ikuharas work taking every opportunity to question the patriarchy, but for an anime to be about individuals who dont fit into society making a life for themselves without any attachments outside of their own personal interests, with no real beliefs or values outside of their need to survive, and for this to come out way back in 1997, I find it more surprising that the series EVENTUALLY became big over there. But more to the point, Cowboy Bebop was, perhaps inadvertently, designed to be successful in America, so by ripping it off, Firefly became so popular that over fifteen years later, it has its own line of Lootcrate merch. And yet, despite the many similarities, Cowboy Bebop is still superior to Firefly in every conceivable way, and its able to be so without having to try nearly as hard as Firefly did.

First off, as much as I love it, Firefly was never that great at drama. Yeah there was danger, and characters would die, but actual emotional conflict? It would pop up in small doses, but never in any engaging way. It also, like MANY series both here and in Japan, used dangling plot threads to keep you watching. There were mysteries to be solved, romantic interests to be resolved, conspiracies to unravel... When shows do this, it can be great, but it still feels like theres a carrot dangling in front of your face, daring you to run towards it. It goes perhaps without saying that Cowboy Bebop had none of these issues. It never needs to try to grab your attention... You dont need to worry about whats going to happen later on in the story, because everything thats happening is perfectly interesting on its own. You dont just want to see the characters prevail, and overcome each obstacle, preserving the status quo, you want to see them overcome themselves and break the stasis theyve surrounded themselves with in order to find whatever it is theyve been missing.

Cowboy Bebop is about four outcasts with nowhere to go, nowhere to call home, and pasts that they can no longer return to. In a sense, theyve given up anything they once held dear in order to just survive day to day, putting their loved ones, morals and dreams aside because even if there is something for them to go back to, which isnt always the case, doing so would carry unimaginable consequences, so you wind up having no idea whether you want them to find closure or just move forward. Anybody whos held a job in order to pay the bills can immediately relate to this, and yet the fact that the crew of the Bebop have taken on even more uncertainty and risk by working a job that lets them hold onto a little bit of freedom by being their own bosses still makes them so easy to idolize. You get episodes of backstory for the entire main cast save for Ed, and these episodes are by far the best of the bunch because of everything they teach us about their past lives and how they wound up in this life, and then youll get the one-off episodes that are somehow just as awesome on their own, with so many imaginative and complex ideas that fit perfectly into the Bebop universe. All of these episodes, in their own way, explore the dichotomy of life, death, and the purpose that each serves.

Cowboy Bebop was originally available from Bandai, both in individual cases and in a much more attractive Remix collection set, which was my copy of the series for years until Funimation bought the rights, and released it on Gorram Blu-Ray. I dont care how much your physical copies of this series mean to you, you need to buy it on Blu-Ray. Its a lot cheaper than the Amazon Exclusive version, although that one DOES come with a whole slew of bonus goodies. The movie, Knocking on Heavens door, is also available pretty cheap at most locations, and its also really great. The manga adaptations are also easily available stateside, although youre best bet is to look online.

Cowboy Bebop is not just an example of how anime can break its own rules and still be great, nor is it just an example of how good an anime from the nineties could look. It is also, and perhaps most importantly, an example of how a character driven story doesnt need to have a plot, especially if its written in such a way that the characters ARE the plot. Theyre all so likeable and so interesting that there are literally no boring moments throughout the series, because everything that happens involves them or is related to them in some way. Ive heard some people complain about the crew not landing very many bounties, but I honestly think thats the whole point. The ship is symbolic of the status quo that so many other shows rely on. As long as they stay there, sheltered from their old lives, they can never succeed, nor can they fail. They can never really live, nor can they die. They can only tread water, surviving. That might sound comfortable for some, but for Spike Spiegel, and ultimately for the philosophy of the series, its better to die young than to survive without living. This work, which has become a genre unto itself, is known as Cowboy Bebop, and I give it a 10/10.

    "Whatever your past, you still have a future."

One of the main characters Spike, says this in a particular episode of this series. This line stayed with me throughout the rest of the series & resonated during certain episodes. Eventually, this line formed what I thought was the big question that forms the plot of this of the show: Can you truly feel alive and have a future if you are constantly reminded of the past and how corrupted the world maybe you yourself are?

This question surrounds the main characters (Spike, Lee, Faye, and Edward) and some secondary characters they meet as they travel the galaxy

          
        hunting criminals with bounties on a ship called The Bebop. Each main character has interesting personalties and mysterious pasts that gradually get revealed as the series goes on.

Spike is a tough, aloof guy with impulsive tendencies who can handle a gun, pilot a ship, and do martial arts. He is also empathetic in toward others in a big brother kind-of way. Jet is a pilot and mechanic who equally tough with guns, level headed (rarely impulsive) and empathetic in a fatherly way. Faye is a woman who is frivolous with money, has avoidance tendencies, and can handle a gun and won't hesitate to use her feminine charms to make other men drop their guard. Last but not least, Ed is an androgynous and energetic genius hacker who is very free-spirited and child-like.

As for the secondary characters, many are notable because they either serve as commentary on the real world in and/or they are sympathetic. One example is an animal rights group that threatens to turn people into monkeys unless they stop hunting a certain animal. Another notable aspect of the secondary characters is that they are diverse in body, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, and personality. The depiction of gay and intersex people in this anime is really progressive when you consider that the anime was made in the late 90's. Also, the way many dark-skinned characters are sprinkled throughout the anime is nice too b/c they are rarely seen in anime. 

Besides the plot and characters, the world building is really creative because it mixes several genres including spaghetti westerns, sci-fi, noir, and in one episode slasher films. This created the major themes of the anime (nostalgia and freedom) and makes you want to keep watching to see what the characters will encounter next.

In addition to the plot, characters, and world building, the soundtrack is incredible. Composed by Yoko Kanno, the soundtrack is rooted in jazz (specifically bebop jazz), but also features other genres like heavy metal and a dash of J-Pop. The fast-paced upbeat bebop jazz really compliments action scenes well. Furthermore, the opening title theme & its visuals are truly striking and memorable.

Last but not least, the animation is really beautiful at times and not so beautiful at others. The beautiful moments  are focused on the sky, like in one scene where Spike is smoking while watching the sunset. The not-so-beautiful moments come during the jump to hyperspace.

Overall, this was a really entertaining and enjoyable anime. If you are interested in sci-fi or saw Samurai Champloo first like I did & enjoyed it, then give this anime a try.

    Going into this series, I was expecting a lot. I was consistently hearing that this was one of the all time greatest animes. I also kept hearing how great its English Dub is, so of course I watched it dubbed. It 's also the first series I've watched to follow a episodic narrative design, where each episode was treated like a miniature movie. So after finally getting to watch this legendary series here's what I thought of it.

Story:9/10
Brilliantly written and very sophisticated. The main plot revolves around the main characters' past and it explores that in such a beautiful way. Due to it's narrative design

          
        we are given so many memorable episodes with my personal fav being episode 20, "Pierrot Le Fou,' Each episode contains a different story approach and it gives us different genres. And although it wasn't as action packed as DBZ or Bleach, this series had great and memorable action in particular the shootout scenes. This series also had one of the best conclusions ever, it ended in a bang. The only problem I had here was that it suffered a lil bit from exposition.

Art:10/10
This was the one area that impressed me the most. This series came out in the 1990s yet it looks better than most animes I've watched in the 2000s. The animation never lost consistency and it was fluid as water. The movie quality was great as like I said, each episode felt like a short movie. Visuals were great and very detailed and none of the character designs felt out of place. Every character here was drawn in a very realistic way.

Sound:10/10
This is where Cowboy Bebop stands out from most animes. For one it has SUPERB voice acting. It wasn't over the top at all and everyone's voice fit and Spike sounded so cool. The dub is so great that I honestly believe it to be superior to the Japanese version. And of course the soundtrack, one of the best any person can hear in ANYTHING. The opening song, ending song, to its beautiful jazz flowing in the background, the music perfectly matched the show's atmosphere. If I was blind and had only my ears, this anime will still heavily satisfy me.

Character:9/10
The development here is incredible but what really stands out is that we really connect wit these characters like their actual people. And really love the relationships between the main characters cuz although they don't always get along their all they have and it leads to some emotional moments. The main antagonist here is great cuz although not overly powerful, the character plays a huge impact on the main character. Whenever these two were together you'll almost cry inside cuz their past is so deep.

Final Verdict

One word, masterpiece. Simply one of the greatest animated works you can ever find. Cowboy Bebop is just too important to the anime world and its one series that all of us needs to see. This series is all about style, and when it comes to style there's no better anime out there than this. With its beautiful animation, great music, and endearing characters, there's no doubt why Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the landmark title in Anime.

    Honestly anime is very hit and miss with me, either I love it to death or I hate it. This is an anime I love. I think it's a wonderful anime and, all in all I actually enjoyed all the episodes, which almost never happens with me and anime. I binge watched this in 2 days and now understand why this is largely regarded as a classic.

Story: 10/10

While the story is of an episodic nature,  every bits helps develop the characters and the universe, and such it doesn't feel filler at all. It's a great mix between sci fi and space opera, and there's

          
        effort done to give so credibility to the universe it's set in. Basically, it's set around a crew of bounty hunters in the years 2071, and their travels around the solar system looking for bounties. The setting is quite simple, but it's well executed, and every episodes adds a bit more to the characters stories, so that we learn every time a bit more of their past, and of their tragedies.

Which brings me to:

Characters: 10/10

The story is great in it's own way, but if it works so well it's because it's carried by such a great set of characters. From Ed the tomboyish hacker to Ein the Welsh corgi, every characters add something to the show, making it so much more interesting to watch? They are all well thought out and developed more and more as the series continue, making us learn of their pasts by small bits. The voice acting is great too and brings a lot to the characters. I've only watched the sub, but i've heard the dubs were great so I think I'm going to watch that next, to compare the two. 

Sound: 10/10

The soundtrack of this show is just amazing. from the OP,  Tanks!, that's energetic af and sets the tone for whats to come, and the ending song, the Real Folks Blues, it really sets up a great atmosphere. The background music itself is amazing too, and helps move the story along. It's not a forgettable soundtrack, that's for sure, and every bit of it, from the harmonica tune to the sax solo  works very well with it all. The ending song  changes twice, only for one episode each, but it works really well and shows significant twist in the plot. Especially after the last episode. The ending song there is just perfect to stare at  your screen...

Art: 10/10 

For a show made in 1998 the art and animation aged remarkably well. It doesn't look too dated and the colour scheme helps to set up this western-like vision of the future. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the fight scenes, in space or otherwise, are really a sight to behold. The characters designs are also memorable, and the background looks awesome. I found some of the skies particularly beautiful.

Enjoyement: 10/10

I think it's a trully enjoyable show. It can be comedic, serious, sometime even sentimental 
( cause let's be real at the end you do care about what happens to the characters) but there's not one episode I didn't enjoy. They might be weird, funny or serious, I think they all have their appeal and such the show has a great binge watch capacity.

Overall: 10/10

I honestly recommend this to everyone looking to start  a new show. It's just great, and for me at least truly deserves to be put among the masterpieces of anime. Of all the anime I saw so far I won't hesitate to say that this was by far the best yet.

    These are just my vague thoughts about the show, not particularly organized or backed up with specific details from the show itself.  Probably not the best way to write a review, but I am basically just here to praise the show and state what I liked :]

Amazing series.  Despite the fact it's episodic, you can see a connected story line through the characters and the way they and their relationships develop. 

I truly loved every character on the Bebop-- they all filled different roles without seeming forced.  They all had pasts that affected them even if we don't ever fully learn what

          
        their past is.  Character relationships and growth are what I look for in a series, and this one nailed it.  Also, this series has Edward!  Can anybody NOT love her?  I don't think so.

Cowboy Bebop had a really nice mix of humor, seriousness, darkness, and suspense.  The jokes and the banter between the characters always felt genuine and made me smile.  The show really knew how to have silly moments while still remaining mature.

I am not a big fan of tons of action and gun fights or space-themed things.  But this series made me like it.  It made it believable--  the story's universe was built so well that everything felt real while watching it.

The show can be appreciated for the individual episodes as well as the overall themes, the biggest of which is whether or not your past makes you who you are.  An over-done theme, perhaps, but Bebop's take on it was really well done because you could see it from so many points of view.

I'm not one to normally notice soundtracks because I am so focused on the story and the visuals, but Cowboy Bebop's soundtrack definitely stuck out to me.  I loved it.  The music always helped improve the scenes and the mood and was never a distraction.

The art is unique and beautiful in its own way, especially from being nearly 15 years old now.

In the end, I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  It started off slow for me but when I took the time and patience to appreciate it, I couldn't turn it off.  I definitely think there's a lot of rewatch value in the series as well, and I can't wait to show it to more people.

    "Just a cowboy ma'am"

Cowboy Bebop is most likely one of the most famous anime out there. And it is, for very good reasons. It's a classic, and one of the first anime with a good English dub. The anime takes place in the future, following the adventures of Spike and Jet, bounty hunters (or cowboys) looking for cash. As they go about their adventures, they pick up a lady (Faye Valentine), a dog (Ein), and a boy (who's really a girl named Ed). Many things happen to them, and you eventually learn more about Spike and his interesting background.

Story - 9/10

While having what is IMO

          
        the best ending possible in any anime, it has too many filler episodes that don't have anything to do with the actual plot. This would be fine, if they actual episodes were very good, but some of them have barely anything to do with hunting down criminals, such as the one where they purchase some sketchy mushrooms. Otherwise the main plot line of the show is amazing, and the ending wraps it all up very nicely. The backstory of some of the characters is also what makes this show fantastic.

Art - 10/10

Even though it is a very old show, it still stands up there as one of the best drawn anime I've ever seen. The animation during fights is fantastic, especially for it's time and I've never seen anything like it when I first saw it on T.V. Characters are well drawn with realistic features, nothing too exaggerated like most animes nowaday.

Sound - 10/10

Oh boy, where do I even start. This show has what I want to say the best soundtrack of any anime I've ever seen in my entire life. Maybe it's my bias because it's one of the first anime I've ever seen, but The Seatbelts did an amazing job and the ending theme song (The Real Folk Blues) is one of my favorite songs of all time. I constantly hum it almost all the time in fact, and some of my colleagues have even been interested to know here it is from.

And the English dub is one of the first best ones out there. I really felt the emotions in this dub unlike most other dubs which are just bland. However, this one definitely stands out in terms of english dub quality. 

Character - 9/10

While the show did an amazing job developing Spike's and Jet's characters, I felt that Vicious and the others could've been done a little better. I still felt like I wanted to know more about them, but sadly the show didn't deliver on that aspect. However, for sure, they did an amazing job for what they did develop.

Enjoyment - 10/10

I love this anime. It's another of the ones that I grew up with, and it still sticks with me even today. It was the show that really stood out to me, and probably the one that got me into watching even more anime. Even after re-watching it recently, I still felt compelled to watch it again because that's how I much I enjoyed it. The fight scenes were splendid, the ending stunning, soundtrack fantastic, there was almost no downsides, and for the ones that it has, it makes up for two fold.

    Cowboy Bebop is by far my favorite anime. Its got a great story that keeps the viewer entertained, laughing, and at some parts on the verge of tears that said I would like to say that I love the jazzy kinda dark feel of the overall anime and think that it was done very well. On the other hand I feel like it was pretty short... which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing because they didn\'t milk it for every dime like some newer anime but It leaves the viewer yearning for more.

    Cowboy Bebop is, in effect, an episodic, slice of life sort of series revolving around our Space Cowboys (and girls) Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed. This review is here to tackle some points about the series I feel are worth mentioning, as I know it's all been said before.

Now Cowboy Bebop has it all; great characters with good backstories, smooth animation, amazing music and lots of humor. So why don't I love it? Quite simply, Cowboy Bebop was a frustrating experience for me! I watched the series on and off over a couple of months, far longer than it normally takes for me to finish

          
        a series this short. I found it very off-putting that, with such interesting characters, the creators chose to spend so much time doing nothing with them! 

As others have mentioned, each episode is a hit or a miss. Some tackle the main characters, mix in some plot, throw in new characters or ideas and are just amazing overall. And then others are meandering and pointless. 

Now this is found in any slice-of-life series, it comes with the package. But in Cowboy Bebop it especially bothered me to spend an episode watching some character do something I could care less about when there are four amazing, interesting characters with stories that could fill several seasons sitting around and not getting anywhere! 

Vicious and Julia for example; why did we spend an episode watching Jet's old friend's daughter come to grips with her father's lack of affection for her? I honestly can't remember. And then you have Vicious and Julia's very few appearances despite being characters very important in the overall plot and intriguing characters in their own right.

So before you hit the non helpful button, please remember that I do hold the series in high regard. It is a very well-made series that raises many interesting questions and concepts; and while some episodes frustrated me, others fascinated me. There's nothing wrong with the series, and I know many people like it's meandering nature and enjoy the lack of an over-arching plot (which, by the way, was rather tidily summed up in two eps at the end, nicely done). 

While my objective opinion is that it is a well-made series, well worth a watch, my subjective view wishes it was different, that it had been a story about Spike's past, about Vicious, about their friendship, about Julia's love and Jet and Faye's stories as well. It is because I loved the characters so much that I wanted more of them, wanted to see them more, know them more.
